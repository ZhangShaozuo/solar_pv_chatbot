{"text":"Figure 1. The difference between solar thermal and solar PV systems\n1.1 Introduction\nThe sun delivers its energy to us in two main forms: heat and light. There are two main\ntypes of solar power systems, namely, solar thermal systems that trap heat to warm up\nwater, and solar PV systems that convert sunlight directly into electricity as shown in\nFigure 1.\nWhen the PV modules are exposed to sunlight, they generate direct current (\"DC\")\nelectricity. An inverter then converts the DC into alternating current (\"AC\") electricity,\nso that it can feed into one of the building\u2019s AC distribution boards (\"ACDB\") without\naffecting the quality of power supply.\nFigure 2. Grid-connected solar PV system configuration","metadata":709}
{"text":"1.2 Types of Solar PV System\nSolar PV systems can be classified based on the end-use application of the technology.\nThere are two main types of solar PV systems: grid-connected (or grid-tied) and off-grid\n(or stand alone) solar PV systems.\nGrid-connected solar PV systems\nThe main application of solar PV in Singapore is grid-connected, as Singapore\u2019s main\nisland is well covered by the national power grid. Most solar PV systems are installed\non buildings or mounted on the ground if land is not a constraint. For buildings, they are\neither mounted on the roof or integrated into the building. The latter is also known as\nBuilding Integrated Photovoltaics (\"BIPV\"). With BIPV, the PV module usually displaces\nanother building component, e.g. window glass or roof\/wall cladding, thereby serving a\ndual purpose and offsetting some costs.\nThe configuration of a grid-connected solar PV system is shown in Figure 2.","metadata":912}
{"text":"A building has two parallel power supplies, one from the solar PV system and the other\nfrom the power grid. The combined power supply feeds all the loads connected to the\nmain ACDB.\nThe ratio of solar PV supply to power grid supply varies, depending on the size of the\nsolar PV system. Whenever the solar PV supply exceeds the building\u2019s demand, excess\nelectricity will be exported into the grid. When there is no sunlight to generate PV\nelectricity at night, the power grid will supply all of the building\u2019s demand.\nFigure 3. Off-grid solar PV system configuration\nA grid-connected system can be an effective way to reduce your dependence on utility\npower, increase renewable energy production, and improve the environment.","metadata":724}
{"text":"Off-grid solar PV systems\nOff-grid solar PV systems are applicable for areas without power grid. Currently, such\nsolar PV systems are usually installed at isolated sites where the power grid is far away,\nsuch as rural areas or off-shore islands. But they may also be installed within the city in\nsituations where it is inconvenient or too costly to tap electricity from the power grid.\nFor example, in Singapore, several URA parking sign lights are powered by off-grid solar\nPV systems.\nAn off-grid solar PV system needs deep cycle rechargeable batteries such as lead-acid,\nnickel-cadmium or lithium-ion batteries to store electricity for use under conditions\nwhere there is little or no output from the solar PV system, such as during the night, as\nshown in Figure 3 below.","metadata":774}
{"text":"1.3 Solar PV Technology\nThis section gives a brief description of the solar PV technology and the common\ntechnical terms used.\nA solar PV system is powered by many crystalline or thin film PV modules. Individual\nPV cells are interconnected to form a PV module. This takes the form of a panel for easy\ninstallation.\nPV cells are made of light-sensitive semiconductor materials that use photons to dislodge\nelectrons to drive an electric current. There are two broad categories of technology used\nfor PV cells, namely, crystalline silicon, as shown in Figure 4 which accounts for the\nmajority of PV cell production; and thin film, which is newer and growing in popularity.\nThe \"family tree\" in Figure 5 gives an overview of these technologies available today\nand Figure 6 illustrates some of these technologies.\nFigure 4.

{"text":"Crystalline Silicon and Thin Film Technologies\nCrystalline cells are made from ultra-pure silicon raw material such as those used in\nsemiconductor chips. They use silicon wafers that are typically 150-200 microns (one\nfifth of a millimetre) thick.\nThin film is made by depositing layers of semiconductor material barely 0.3 to 2\nmicrometres thick onto glass or stainless steel substrates.

{"text":"Apart from aesthetic differences, the most obvious difference amongst PV cell\ntechnologies is in its conversion efficiency, as summarised in Table 1.\nFor example, a thin film amorphous silicon PV array will need close to twice the space\nof a crystalline silicon PV array because its module efficiency is halved, for the same\nnominal capacity under Standard Test Conditions1 (STC) rating.\nFor crystalline silicon PV modules, the module efficiency is lower compared to the sum\nof the component cell efficiency due to the presence of gaps between the cells and the\nborder around the circuit i.e., wasted space that does not generate any power hence\nlower total efficiency.","metadata":669}
{"text":"Effects of Temperature\nAnother important differentiator in solar PV performance, especially in hot climates, is\nthe temperature coefficient of power. PV cell performance declines as cell temperature\nrises.\nFor example, in bright sunlight, cell temperatures in Singapore can reach over 70\u00baC,\nwhereas PV modules are rated at a cell temperature of 25\u00baC. The loss in power output\nat 70\u00baC is therefore measured as (70 - 25) x temperature coefficient.\nMost thin film technologies have a lower negative temperature coefficient compared to\ncrystalline technologies. In other words, they tend to lose less of their rated capacity as\ntemperature rises. Hence, under Singapore\u2019s climatic condition, thin film technologies\nwill generate 5-10% more electricity per year.\nA PV module data sheet should specify the temperature coefficient.

{"text":"2.1 Introduction\nThere are many examples overseas where PV modules are mounted on the roof and\nintegrated into building fa\u00e7ades. They work particularly well in Europe and North America,\nas south-facing fa\u00e7ades in these regions are well exposed to the sun.\nIn Singapore, we have to consider that the sun passes almost directly overhead. This is\nbecause we are located near the Equator, and the path of the sun follows the Equator,\nwith seasonal variations of up to 23.5o to the north or south. Therefore there are optimal\npositions to locate the PV modules that have to be taken into consideration. Refer to\nAppendix A for examples of solar PV systems on buildings in Singapore.","metadata":677}
{"text":"2.2 Installation Angle\nTo maximise electricity production for use in Singapore, the best location for the\nPV modules to be installed is right on top of a building, facing the sky. The possible\ninstallation options are shown in Figure 13.\nFigure 13. Where to install PV modules on a building in Singapore\nVertical fa\u00e7ades and steeply sloped roofs tend to suffer a big loss in the ability to generate\nelectricity in exchange for higher public visibility.\nWith the PV modules facing the sky, it is possible to improve the yield by installing PV\nmodules on trackers to follow the sun from east to west during the day (single-axis\ntrackers), and from north to south during seasonal changes (dual-axis trackers).\nHowever, trackers can only improve system performance under direct sunshine, and\nthey give no advantage in diffused sunlight conditions, such as on cloudy or hazy days.\nThe down side of having flat-mounted PV modules is that they tend to get dirty from\nrain water and dust. See Figure 14. It is therefore better to mount the PV modules at an\nincline (10-15o for framed modules, or as little as 3-5o for unframed modules), to allow\nrain water to properly drain off\nFigure 14. PV module frames trap dirt as water evaporates from a\nflat-mounted PV module","metadata":1258}
{"text":"2.3 Avoid Shading PV Modules\nPV modules should be free from shade. Shading of any single cell of a crystalline silicon\nPV module will drastically reduce the output of the entire PV module.\nThin film PV modules are more tolerant to partial shading than crystalline silicon PV\nmodules. Typical culprits include shadows cast by tall trees and neighbouring buildings.","metadata":363}
{"text":"2.4 Aesthetic and Creative Approaches in Mounting PV Modules\nBesides mounting PV modules on the rooftop, customised PV modules can be\nintegrated into the building fa\u00e7ade in a creative, aesthetically pleasing manner. They can\nbe mounted on any part of the rooftop or external walls that is well exposed to sunlight\ne.g. skylights, cladding, windows, and external shading devices.\nThey can also be integrated into external structures such as fa\u00e7ades and canopies, as\nshown in Figure 15 and Figure 16, respectively.\nFigure 15. BIPV modules integrated\ninto a fa\u00e7ade\nFigure 16. BIPV modules integrated into a\nskylight canopy","metadata":619}
{"text":"2.5 Solar PV Output Profile\nSolar PV only produces electricity when sunlight is available. The output of a solar PV\nsystem varies with its rated output, temperature, weather conditions, and time of the\nday. The power output profile of the PV installation as shown in Figure 17, at a selected\ntest site in Singapore collected over a period from 2002-2004, in terms of its capacity\nfactor, shows a high variation of solar PV output.\nPV Output capacity factor = Ratio of the actual output of the PV installation at time (t) over its output if it\nhad operated at full rated output.\nFigure 17.

{"text":"2.6 Solar PV Yield\nThe amount of electricity you are able to generate from a solar PV system depends not\nonly on the availability of sunshine but also on the technology you choose to install. For\nexample, a typical 10-kW rooftop solar PV system in Singapore would produce about\n11,000 to 12,500 kWh annually using crystalline PV modules, and 12,000 to 14,500 kWh\nannually with amorphous silicon thin film PV modules.","metadata":416}
{"text":"The cost of your solar PV system will depend on many factors: system configuration,\nequipment options, labour cost and financing cost. Prices also vary depending on factors\nsuch as whether or not your home is new, and whether the PV modules are integrated\ninto the roof or mounted on the roof. The cost also depends on the system size or\nrating, and the amount of electricity it produces.\nGenerally, solar PV systems entail high capital costs. With solar power, you can save on\nthe purchase of electricity from the grid. But even with these savings, it will take a long\ntime to recover the capital cost of the solar PV installation. The operating costs for solar\nPV installations are negligible, but the annual maintenance cost beyond the warranty\nperiod may amount to 0.5% to 1% of the capital cost of the installation.\nTherefore on an overall basis, solar PV-derived electricity is still much more expensive\nthan that from the power grid. However, the cost of solar PV has historically been falling\nby about 4% a year, and if this continues, solar PV may be competitive within the next\n10 years.

{"text":"Choosing between bids\nIf there are several bids for the installation of a solar PV system (it is generally a good\npractice to obtain multiple bids), consumers should take steps to ensure that all of\nthe bids received are made on the same basis. Comparing a bid for a solar PV system\nmounted on the ground against another bid for a rooftop system is like comparing apples\nto oranges.\nBids should clearly state the maximum generating capacity of the solar PV system\n[measured in watts peak (Wp) or kilowatts peak (kWp)]. If possible, the bids should\nspecify the system capacity in AC watts, or specify the output of the system at the\ninverter.\nBids should also include the total cost of getting the solar PV system components,\nincluding hardware, software, supporting structure, meter, installation, connection to the\ngrid (if applicable), permitting, goods and services tax, warranty, and future maintenance\ncost (if applicable).","metadata":928}
{"text":"Solar PV system warranty\nA solar PV system is an investment that should last a long time, typically two to three\ndecades for grid-connected applications. The industry standard for a PV module warranty\nis 20-25 years on the power output.\nThere are two main components to a PV module warranty:\n\u2022 A workmanship warranty that offers to repair, replace or refund the purchase\nin case of defects. The period varies from one to as long as ten years,\ndepending on the manufacturer. Two to five years is typical; and\n18\n\u2022 A limited power output warranty that offers a variety of remedies in case the\nPV module\u2019s output under STC drops below certain level. Most manufacturers\nwarrant at least 90% of the minimum rated output for 10 years, and 80% of\nthe minimum rated output for 20-25 years. Take note that the minimum rated\noutput is usually defined as 95% of the rated output to allow for manufacturing\nand measurement tolerances. See Figure 18 for details.\nFigure 18. Understanding a manufacturer\u2019s limited power warranty\nTake note that under the limited power warranty, manufacturers seldom offer to replace\nthe PV module itself. Rather, at their sole discretion, they may offer to:\n\u2022 Repair the defective PV modules;\n\u2022 Supply enough new PV modules to replace the lost power output in a PV\narray. For example, if your 20kW PV array only produces 16.1kW under STC,\nsix years after installation, the manufacturer may opt to supply you with 1kW\nof PV modules to make up for the shortfall; or\n\u2022 Refund you for the lost power output, after deduction according to the number\nof years in use. For a 25-year warranty, the annual deduction is normally 4%.\nFor example, if you find that your 20kW PV array only produces 16.1kW under\nSTC, six years after installation, the manufacturer may opt to reimburse your\npurchase price minus 24% (6 years x 4%).","metadata":1835}
{"text":"In all cases, the manufacturer does not cover your costs of dismounting, transporting,\nand reinstalling the PV modules. The warranty also excludes problems resulting from\nimproper installations; repairs, changes or dismounting by unqualified personnel;\naccidental breakage or abuse; lightning strikes and other acts of God.\nSignificantly, most manufacturers specify that the PV module output will be determined\nby the flash testers in their own premises, rather than by a third party.\nThe solar PV system contractor should assist in determining whether a PV module\ndefect is covered by warranty, and should handle the situation with the manufacturer.\nRegular maintenance\nDuring the defect liability period (usually for 12 months after installation), solar PV system\ncontractors usually use remote monitoring data to prepare monthly performance reports\nof the installed solar PV system. They should come on site to rectify any problems\nflagged by the remote monitoring service.","metadata":976}
{"text":"Other relevant matters\nAnother matter to be aware of is that PV module manufacturers are constantly upgrading\ntheir products, and adapting new sizes and dimensions to suit market requirements.\nThis means that you may no longer be able to buy an identical PV module to replace\na defective one in your PV array a few years after installation. Newer PV modules are\nlikely to be more efficient or have different physical dimensions, and may no longer fit\nexactly into the gap left by the old PV module.\nThis does not matter much on a large, ground-mounted solar PV power plant, because\nthe new modules can form a new row. But on a building-mounted solar PV system it\nmay spoil the aesthetics, and may cause problems to the electrical configuration.","metadata":744}
{"text":"4.1 Electrical Installation Licence\nAn electrical installation refers to any electrical wiring, fitting or apparatus used for\nthe conveyance and control of electricity in any premises. A solar PV system installed\nwithin such premises forms part of the consumer\u2019s electrical installation and should\ncomply with the requirements stipulated in the Electricity Act (Cap. 89A), the Electricity\n(Electrical Installations) Regulations and the Singapore Standard CP5 Code of Practice\nfor Electrical Installations.\nUnder the Electricity Act, the Energy Market Authority (\"EMA\") licenses all nonresidential\nelectrical installations, with demand exceeding 45 kilo volt ampere or kVA. For\nresidential electrical installations and non-residential electrical installations with demand\nbelow the threshold 45kVA, no electrical installation licence is required.\nThe licence requires the owner of the electrical installation to engage an LEW to take\ncharge of the electrical installation and comply with the relevant safety standards and\nrequirements. Your appointed LEW shall consult SP PowerGrid Ltd on their technical\nrequirements and procedures, if you wish to operate your solar PV system in parallel\nwith the power grid.

You will have to apply to SP Services (\"SPS\") by following the\napplication procedure set out in Appendix B.\nNon-contestable consumers are compensated by SPS for electricity exported to the\npower grid by way of a credit adjustment to the consumer\u2019s monthly electricity bill,\nbased on the prevailing low-tension electricity tariff less the grid charge.\nThe credit adjustment will effectively compensate the non-contestable consumer for\nthe amount of electricity exported into the power grid during that month.\nThis scheme to compensate non-contestable consumers with generation capacity of\nless than 1MW for the electricity they export into the power grid is not applicable to\nthose consumers whose electricity consumption is metered under the master-sub\nmetering scheme.\nMaster-sub metering schemes refer to metering arrangements where there is a\nmaster-meter measuring the overall electricity consumed by the building (i.e. both the\nindividual units and the common services), with sub-meters measuring the usage of the\nindividual units. Such metering schemes are typically used in private condominiums\nand commercial buildings.\nUnder a master-sub metering arrangement, the electricity that an individual unit attempts\nto export into the grid may in fact be used up by the common services or by other\nindividual units. As it is not possible to track the actual flow of the electricity exported\nby the individual units, the credit adjustment scheme cannot be applied to those under\nthe master-sub metering scheme.","metadata":1795}
