Dear Sir or Madam,
I am a Research Analyst for BloombergNEF, an energy market research firm. We are currently conducting our annual ClimateScope - an initiative to reach out to energy market participants of countries across the world to better inform our research. You can learn more about the initiative here.
I have a question regarding the SolarNova programme: As part of the programme, can solar project developers rely on standardised power purchase agreements (PPAs) or are the PPAs negotiated with developers individually? Are the terms of the PPA revealed to the public?
Thank you in advance and I look forward to hearing from you.

","Thank you for your interest in our SolarNova programme.
The SolarNova programme is a whole-of-government initiative jointly led by the Economics Development Board (EDB) and the Housing and Development Board (HDB). Under the SolarNova Programme, HDB aggregates the solar photovoltaic (PV) demand across the various public sector buildings, and engage solar PV vendors through leasing contracts to design, build, finance, own, operate and maintain solar PV systems for a leasing period of 20 years. 
While HDB acts as the aggregator and procurer, the leasing contractual agreements are signed between respective government agencies and town councils. Known as Solar Leasing Agreement, these agreements set the terms and conditions for effective management of the solar leasing contract over the contract period, e.g. the commercial terms. To ensure a fair and open tendering process, HDB will provide draft solar leasing agreements as part of the tender documents. These information are provided to prospective tenderers through Singapore government tendering system GeBiz www.gebiz.gov.sg. 
Following the tender award, the respective government agencies and town councils/building owners will sign the leasing agreement with the contracted solar PV vendor. While the general terms are largely the same, we recognise that each Building Owner/Manager may have their own unique operational requirements. These can be factored into the agreement (e.g. via an addendum), subject to agreement by both parties (i.e. building owner and solar PV vendor). However, key contracture terms, e.g. the commercial terms, are non-negotiable as these formed the basis for tender evaluation and are contractually binding. 
I hope the above is sufficient to address your queries. Thank you.

"Good afternoon XXXXX
Thank you for your email.
Under the provided link, Smart and Sustainable Living, Eco-lifestyle, Energy efficiency, it only provides a section about what an individual can do for his/her home.
How about the area where one lives in?
Has HDB come up with guidelines on how each Town Council can/should do so that all TCs in Singapore can be energy efficient, reduce the amount of energy?
I have to quote LTA on energy efficiency, not only has it introduced LED lamp posts, LTA has undergone its own studies and are adopting a more prudent use of light fixtures at its overhead bridges, covered walkways.
Will HDB provide the same guidelines or similar? I have travel around Singapore and the amount of light ""pollution"" and excess use of lights are more than above average. In addition, there seems to be no standard guideline what is the latest timing all lightings are to be switched off.
I am sure the Town Council does not have the expertise in these matters as most services are outsourced.
With this, how can the(ALL) Town Councils in Singapore be in sync with the government's climate action plan?
PUB has/is running campaigns to get citizens to reduce water usage, but there seems to be no concerted effort to reduce energy usage or be more energy efficient even though there is a Climate Change Secretariat in Singapore set up after Singapore became a signatory to the Paris Agreement.
Hope HDB can shed some light or enlighten me.

","        Thank you for your email. I’m happy to share some of our sustainability efforts in HDB towns.
2        Since 2010, we have developed a Sustainable Development Framework to guide our sustainability efforts in HDB towns. Under the framework, one of the objectives is to achieve Low Carbon Development. We have adopted two main strategies (1) To achieve greater energy efficiency, and (2) To adopt clean and renewable energy.
3        Guided by the strategies, we have introduced various initiatives into our towns. For example, we have replaced the T5 lighting with LED lighting in the common corridors. With the advancement in technology, we have successfully testbedded the smart LED lighting which enables a further energy reduction of up to 50%. We are extending smart LED lighting to all new BTOs.
4        We have also embarked on the SolarNova programme with the support from EDB to accelerate the deployment of solar photovoltaic systems in Singapore. It is estimated that under the programme, about 420 GWh of solar energy will be generated annually. This is about 5% of Singapore’s total energy consumption or equivalent to powering 88,000 4-room flats. We are progressively rolling out 220MWp of solar panels across 5500 HDB blocks which will align with Singapore’s plans to generate 350MWp of solar power by 2020.
5        There are other initiatives that we are testbedding or rolling out, such as the elevator energy regenerative system which harnesses the energy while the lift is moving or braking and the smart energy meter which monitors the energy consumption in the common areas.
6        Hope this addresses your questions. Thank you.

In addition, I note from the picture you provided of the view from your home that you are on relatively equal height level with the solar panel installation at the neighbouring rooftop. As the solar panels will be angled upwards towards the sun and away from your unit, it is highly unlikely that you will experience any form of glare from the solar panels.

Subject: Solar Panel Installation in XXXX  between 10 to 12 noon - 28th May 2019.
I write this with deep concerns as to how this tender was awarded :
The 2 lifts were connected to a SINGLE system as such when the Solar panels were to be commissioned - BOTH lifts had to be shut down to cut the power over.
I know that 2 or more lifts were installed to avoid such inconveniences to residents.
In this block, there are many old residents, what if : 
Someone had a serious fall leading to fractures. 
A medical emergency like a heart attack, a reality as HDB now has Fribillators - installed in many blocks at strategic locations.
Fires which can spread very quickly
Any other life-threatening incidences where medical emergency teams have no access to the victims immediately.
There are NO FIRE ESCAPE ROUTES in any HDB buildings - in 1st world countries - the rear of the apartments have escape stairs in case of such emergencies.
What's the point of lift upgrading, lifts on every floor and HIPs when the human lives are given scant respect? 
Why in your design implementation for your tenders, would your chief architects even consider a single point of failure when every critical installation must have a backup system be it a fail-over power system, servers and any critical component that will impact human inconveniences   lives.
In 1st world countries, such routine sweeping, cleaning, maintenances, repairs   upgrading of ALL PUBLIC UTILITIES are done in the wee hours of the night to early hours to reduce such incumbrances unless its an emergency.
ONLY in S'pore, I believe for the sake of cutting costs, we perform such tasks in the day.
Hope to hear from you as to why these factors were not considered when awarding this tender.
Failing which, I reserve the right to sent this e-mail to online publications.
Thank you,

","Thank you for your feedback and concern.
2          As part of the solar photovoltaic (PV) installation process, it is necessary for the solar PV system to be connected to the electric reticulation of the block via the consumer switchroom at the ground floor of the HDB block. This is to enable the solar energy that is generated to be used to power the common services or be exported. This electric connection requires an electrical shutdown for the block for safety.
3        Prior to the works, shutdown notices were put up at all lift lobbies since 21 May to inform the residents of the electrical supply disruption, including the estimated shutdown duration, which was indicated to take place between 10.45am to 11.45am. The actual electrical shutdown took place within this time frame. We would also like to share that workers were deployed at the block on the day of electrical shutdown (i.e. 28 May) to render support to residents e.g. to carry luggage, groceries, or assist residents up the stairs.
4        With regard to your concerns on HDB lift design, we would like to share that the lifts in HDB blocks are designed with an emergency backup supply. This is to ensure that the lift will always be able to safely transport a resident to the nearest floor in the event of a power failure. Notwithstanding, we are constantly improving our building design. For new HDB blocks and upgrading tenders from Sep 2018 onwards, we have improved on the lift design to ensure that there will be at least 1 lift in operation when there are works affecting the main consumer switchboard.
5        Also, in the event of fire, please do not use the lifts. The staircases are the designated fire escape route for each HDB block.
6        We apologies for the inconvenience caused and seek your understanding. Thank you.

Hi XXXX,
To answer your queries, yes there is a schedule for the shutdown for tie-in, however, the schedule will not be accurate as it will only be confirmed once all relevant parties are available for the date when closer to the shutdown date.
For SolarNova 2   3 projects under Sembcorp, we will be working within the blocks of Ang Mo Kio Town Council, Marsiling-Yew Tee Town Council, Choa Chu Kang Town Council and West Coast Town Council. Normally we provide 1 week notice to Town Council.
For all shutdowns, we will cc the shutdown date and timing to you 1 week before the shutdown from now on, hence, kindly provide the email distribution list for us. In addition, we will try our best to minimize the disruption to the surveillance CCTV.

Dear Sir/Mdm, 
With regards to the Solar Leasing of Grid-Tied Solar Photovoltaic System, we understand that electrical shutdown will be required to facilitate the works as reflected in the Temporary Shut Down Notice as show below:
One of the affected sites will be on the switch room where it houses Polcam equipment – Police CCTV deployed in HDB.
As the managing agent for SPF, can we kindly check whether there is an island-wide schedule for this type of works? 
The reason is to enable minimal disruption to SPF operation as we can plan the resources much more effectively.
Kindly help to advise please. Thank you.
Best Regards

Hi XXXX 
To answer your queries, yes there is a schedule for the shutdown for tie-in, however, the schedule will not be accurate as it will only be confirmed once all relevant parties are available for the date when closer to the shutdown date.
For SolarNova 2   3 projects under Sembcorp, we will be working within the blocks of Ang Mo Kio Town Council, Marsiling-Yew Tee Town Council, Choa Chu Kang Town Council and West Coast Town Council. Normally we provide 1 week notice to Town Council.
For all shutdowns, we will cc the shutdown date and timing to you 1 week before the shutdown from now on, hence, kindly provide the email distribution list for us. In addition, we will try our best to minimize the disruption to the surveillance CCTV.

Dear High Level Management of HDBs,
HDBs are the home to stay for majority of Singaporean. Kindly PLEASE allow a person to sleep-in during weekends at least. Allow a human to rest at ease at their own home PLEASE!! Kindly view the attachment.
Your HDB rules clearly stated: ""Noisy renovations within the flat such as demolishing of walls, removing wall/ floor finishes, cutting of tiles and heavy and excessive drilling works, etc. can only be carried out between 9:00am and 5:00pm on weekdays""
No avenue I can find to write in a feedback to file a complaint on such issue.
It has happened on several Saturdays where SUPER NOISY WORKS are carried out as early as 8+, 9am such as KNOCKING   MASSIVE DRILLING FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME.
29th June 2019 Saturday (Heavy Knocking and Massive Drilling) starts at 9am 
Many other more dates which happened on Saturday mostly and once on Sunday. It is ridiculous.
It is as though they are trying their luck, and I have to call the contractor who sometimes pick up and sometimes do not pick up and no use most of the time. They continued to messed up my/our lives.
I hope HDB can do something about your contractor screening process. Failed!
Dear Ms XXXX
This happened in the Pasir Ris-Punggol district in which you are in-charge of. I hope you do help in this event especially to someone who is sleep deprived for several weeks due to all the morning weekends noise caused by the contractors HDB engaged. I deeply appreciate your help. I needed a good rest on weekends please. Weekends work week are long enough. Please allow my weekends to be at least normal.
Thanks
Sincerely Yours,

"feedback that the unit felt vibrations, suspect caused by the solar panels at the Multistorey carpark","1.        We refer to your feedback on vibrations cause from solar panels.
2.        We have conducted the inspections. We would like to share that there is no solar panel installed at the Multi-Storey Car Park. For XXXX, the solar panels were installed in February this year. For Blk 616, the solar panels were installed in May 2016. Unlike conventional generators, solar panels and systems have no mechanical moving parts that cause vibrations. During the inspection, we did not observe any vibrations.
3.        On 26 October 2019, we also visited your flat. During the visit, you gave feedback that there is an electrostatic charge that can be felt when using your laptop in the study room. The electrostatic charge can be felt only in that particular location in the house as claimed.
4.        Based on our past experience and literature review, electrostatic charge are usually caused by ambient humidity (e.g. dry atmosphere with air-conditioning) or from the machine (i.e. laptop) itself. Moreover, the solar panels are installed on the roof and are properly earthed, and is separated from the study room with walls and ceilings, hence could not contribute to the electrostatic charge observed.
5.        Thank you.

Dear Sir/Madam,
I am XXXXX, a XXXXX. 
My team and I are currently doing a research that studies the installation methods of solar panels on existing buildings, and currently developing a new solution to reduce the problems faced during the installation. We understand that in 2008, HDB conducted its first solar test-bedding project at XXXXX. With this in mind, we would like to ask if we could arrange a short phone interview with you to understand the advantages and drawbacks the installation method in terms of:
	Cost of installation
	Time taken to install the modules, as well as
	Quality of the installation process and maintenance requirements
We sincerely seek your help and hope that you could help us with this request. You may contact me (XXXXX) at XXXXX if you have any queries.
 I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you and have a good day ahead.
Best Regards,

To whom it may concern,
I’m XXXXX, a resident of XXXXX, and a concerned citizen of the global environment. I understand that HDB has launched the SolarNova programme to equip public housing flats with solar panels. May I know if there are any plans to roll out this plan to Simei anytime soon? Our town is in close proximity to the airport, without any high-rise buildings, so the shading effect is much minimized in this part of Singapore. Moreover, the east side tend to get more sunlight and less rain compared to other parts of Singapore. So I really hope to see HDB rolling out this programme to Simei soon, just like many other residents.
On this note, I also read from the news recently that HDB will take into account the wind direction and natural greenery in the design of new flats. Ironically, there has been extensive trees pruning in Simei in the recent years, and the bare trees could barely block out any sound or dust from the roads. As a resident staying close to the roads, it has really disrupted my quality of sleep in the last few years. Can I understand if HDB and NParks actually work together to achieve a common goal?
I really hope to hear a honest reply from your side on these matters, and please do not just give me a general response. Thank you.
Regards,
XXXXX","Thank you for expressing your interest to have solar photovoltaic (PV) panels to be implemented in Simei.
We would like to share that as part of the whole-of-government SolarNova initiative which seeks to implement 350MWp of solar panels across public sector buildings by 2020, HDB has been aggregating solar panel demand from the public sector and calling for bulk SolarNova tenders annually to deploy solar panels across our HDB roofs. With the inclusion of our latest SolarNova Phase 4 tender which was awarded in Oct 2019, we have committed 230MWp of solar panels for 4,550 HDB blocks to date, which are progressively being installed with solar panels on the rooftops.
Due to the large number of installations at HDB blocks under SolarNova, it will take some time to progressively cover our HDB blocks with solar panels. For Simei specifically, we have already worked with the Town Council to identify suitable HDB blocks to install the solar PV panels on the rooftop, and will include these blocks in the next phase of SolarNova, and expect the installations to start in 1-2 years.
For the second part on your query on the tree pruning in Simei in the recent years, we will forward your feedback to East Coast – Fengshan Town Council for their kind follow up action as the Town Council is managing the common areas and will have greater visibility to address your feedback. Thank you.
Yours sincerely

Description: Dear NEA Feedback,
I just learnt from the news that the solar panels are going to be installed over the two reservoirs.
I am pretty concern how it may harm the natural habitat of the reservoirs i.e. having little to no sunlight passing through the water, which maybe necessary for the water plant to grow normally and as the plants affected, how it would impact the rest of the living things that depend on these plants.
I have kids who love to play in the playgrounds. There is no design in the playground to shade children from the heat of the sun, wouldn't it be better if the solar panels could be built over the playgrounds and other outdoor facilities like the basketball courtsbadminton courts
From A Very Concerned Parent
Thank you.

","Thank you for your suggestion for HDB to consider building solar photovoltaic (PV) panels over playgrounds and other outdoor facilities to shade the children or residents, who are utilising the facilities, from the heat of the sun.
HDB is currently leading the whole-of-government SolarNova initiative to implement 350MWp of solar PV panels across the public buildings in Singapore by 2020. In HDB blocks, this is done by installing solar PV panels on the rooftops of the block to generate clean solar energy to power the common areas, including the lifts, lights, and water pumps, and this in turn helps to reduce the carbon footprint.
One of the main considerations for solar PV installations is that the area to be installed must be exposed to sufficient sunlight. To share, solar energy generation is very sensitive to shading conditions; even a small amount of shade will cause the solar energy generation to drop significantly. Generally, ground level installations are usually unsuitable for solar PV as there is significant shading from the surrounding blocks and trees most of the time. This will affect the actual amount of solar energy generated, and are usually not cost effective.
Nevertheless, we will continue to strive to implement solar PV in our HDB towns and estates, where technically feasible, in our efforts to drive environmental sustainability. With the advances in solar PV technology and industry expertise, area previously deemed unsuitable for solar PV installation may become possible eventually.
If you require any further clarifications, please contact me at XXXX. Thank you.

Dear PUB Colleagues
We understand that PUB will be addressing the first query relating to the solar panels. 
On the second query relating to the proposed solar panels for playgrounds   outdoor facilities, we like to clarify that the construction of playgrounds and outdoor facilities do not fall within URA’s purview.  HDB/Town Council or NParks may be the relevant agencies to look into the suggestion, which we note that you have since sought their views too.  URA has no further inputs. 
Thank you.

Dear XXXXX,
During joint visit with Chevalier lift and our LMU staff on 20/11/19 we discovered the sensor wire was damaged by the Solar Panel contractor. This has resulted in triggering of the 2 lifts to homing mode and causing power trip. The heat sensor system is now bypassed to enable the lifts to work thus compromising the safety consideration in the event of fire. Please arrange for your sub-contractor to repair the wire asap.

Feedback DetailSolar Energy
Much has been mentioned about installation of solar panel on HDB rooftops. Could the government give some incentives to encourage installation of solar panels on private houses or shops? This will also help the economy by providing small enterprises business opportunities in learning, installing and developing technology beside contributing to climate change effort. Installing of such panel will reduce heat under the roof and lead to reduction of air-conditioning energy load.

"Hi,
It's a Saturday morning (11/1/20) and installation works for the Solar Photvoltaic System started at about 8.50 am. I wouldn't have minded much if it was light works but this was sawing, grinding, hammering and drilling between 9 to 10.30 am. 
I appreciate HDB's efforts in going green by installing Solar Panels. I understand from the notices in place that installation works are being done between 12/09/19 - 31/01/20. The notice did warn residents of noise and dust during the period.  But could such heavy and noisy works be done on weekdays instead? If it's really necessary, can it be done at a later time of the day if a weekend is needed? I would appreciate the extra hours for sleep and rest on the weekends after a week of grinding hard at work and I believe that would be for many other residents too.
From HDB's website on timings for residents to carry out renovations, so as to minimise disturbance and inconvenience to neighbours:
""Noisy renovations within the flat such as demolishing of walls, removing wall/ floor finishes, cutting of tiles and heavy and excessive drilling works, etc. can only be carried out between 9:00am and 5:00pm on weekdays
Noisy renovations are not allowed on Saturdays, Sundays, Public Holidays and eve of major Public Holidays (i.e. New Year's Day, Chinese New Year, Deepavali, Hari Raya Puasa and Christmas Day)"" 
Shouldn't this be observed too when it comes to maintenance/installation works on the blocks even if not by residents?
Once again, thank you for the efforts in upgrading our homes and going green.
Hammering, sawing and drilling are still ongoing as i finish typing this (10.45 am).
Regards,
Your resident, XXXXX","           We refer to your feedback on noisy works carried out by contractor SembCorp Solar Pte Ltd on Saturday, 11 Jan 2020._x000D_
 2        Generally, we allow contractors to carry out works during Mondays to Fridays from 9.00 am to 6.00 pm, and allow works that are of non-noisy activities on Saturday from 9.00 am to 4.00 pm._x000D_
 3        We have investigated on the matter. On the morning of 11 Jan 2020, the contractor SembCorp Solar Pte Ltd was carrying out coring works which involved opening a hole through the concrete floor. _x000D_
 4        We apologise for the disturbance and inconvenience caused. The contractor has been reminded not to conduct any noisy works on Saturdays so as not to disturb residents’ rest._x000D_

Dear XXXXX
Greenridges - Stream 
Why was this not briefed during the BTO's briefing/meetings? 
Can the rates be included or absorbed by the contractor in the annual or monthly comprehensive maintenance cost?  
Or are these rates included in the agreement contract - schedule of rates?
Any defect identified at each container during the inspection and the cost of the defect has not included too.
This will be an additional maintenance cost for PWCS system which Town Council has to pay.
Greenweave/Greenview - PV Vacuum
How about the above BTOs?
The rates for the above might differ due to different vendor for PWCS.
Can HDB follow up on this concern and revert to us on the outcome quickly?
Thank you.

Subject: Solving Flood problems - Hydrorock, the most sustainable water management system.
Dear Sir,
I am writing this email in hopes that we can arrange a meet up to you and your team to better present to help solve Singapore’s flooding problems.
Please watch this video (HYDROROCK® UK - YouTube) 
Floods, climate change and rising sea water level will be an inevitable constant problem to a country like Singapore.
We have an innovative DUTCH system that will MITIGATE floods, harvest rain water and PROTECT Singapore from rising sea level.   We hope that you may grant us a meeting to present to you and your team.
We believed and are extremely confident that this system is by far the most applicable and advanced in the world as it has been heavily utilised by the Dutch’s in holland. 
Hydrorock is the newest water management
Brief introduction of Hydrorock . A new way to beef up flood resilience .
100% natural and sustainable product that has the ability to retain 95% of its volume in water and releases it to the ground and environment. It has an extremely long lifetime and does not need any maintenance. It is very simple to use and does exactly what it should do:
during heavy rainfall it stores water underground and infiltrates into the soil where it is used for crops, water supply or any other (environmental) water demand.
Hydrorock is used under parking lots, pavement, roads or just in greenbelts in urban areas as it offers the ability to store under the existing infrastructure and infiltrate it into the soil. It eliminates both chances of floods and impact of droughts.
Specs:
A natural, sustainable and environmental friendly water retention system:
stonewool with 75kg/m3 Over 40% recycled material (stonewool) Storage / retention capacity over 94%
Pressure: at least 2000 kg/m2
Irresponsive to temperature changes and packed in a non-woven cloth with a density of 75 kg/m3
Lifetime: at least 30 years

Dear HDB case manager:
(If your department is not the company's housing construction department, please forward this email to the person in charge of the housing construction department, thank you for your help!)
I am the responsible person of the corporation, XXXX, I will like to recommend a water treatment project to HDB. This project had won six international invention gold award and obtained six patent. If your company will like to introduce this project, it will be very attractive in the industry. This project can be installed in HDB，This project is currently been promoted to many countries by China’s “One Belt One Road” initiatives such as Thailand and is implemented countrywide. Directed mainly by the government, direct drinking water will be installed in 250 primary schools across the country during the first phase. There are many mature and developed prototype projects to serve as references as well in China. Allow me to introduce the pros of this project.
All investment regarding the water service project will be made by the China head office of this Singapore branch company. Your establishment does not need to provide any form of expense.
Direct drinking water into the home, All pipes used are 304 stainless steel pipe.
Regular maintenance by professionals, Filter element replacement cost is free.
Smart management via mobile apps to monitor the water quality and water fees
Water quality of direct drinking water has a far lower TDS value compared to tap water, making it more suitable for drinking.
Both fully built and partly built construction can install this set of piping system.
For further details, we would like to seek a face to face opportunity. There is currently no building in Singapore using a similar system as the mentioned project. If your company will to introduce this project first, it will definitely bring positive feedbacks to the sales of this industry. If you have any queries, please feel free to contact me via email or call me at XXXX. I sincerely hope to a more detailed face to face talk with the relevant person in charge. Thank you for your help.

尊敬的HDB项目负责人：
您好！
（如贵部门不是公司房屋建设部门，请麻烦把此邮件转发给房屋建设部门负责人，谢谢您的帮忙！）
我是中国至简水务的新加坡公司负责人，我有一个水务处理项目推荐给HDB，此项目获得六项发明专利以及六项国际发明金奖，如果被HDB引进，将会是产业的一大吸引力。此项目能够安装在祖屋里，能够给住户带来不一样的体验，目前此项目被中国政府“一带一路”推广至多个亚洲国家，例如泰国、缅甸等等，在中国也有很多成熟的样板工程可以参考。我简单介绍以下项目优势。
1、所有关于本水务项目的投资由本公司的中国总公司承担，HDB不需要花任何费用。
2、直饮水直接入户，全部使用304不锈钢管道。
3、定期专业人员维护，滤芯耗材更换费用全免。
4、用户手机APP智慧管理，查水质、水费等等，人性化体验。
5、直饮水水质TDS值，远远低于自来水的水质，更利于直接饮用。
6、未建成建筑或已建成建筑都能安装此套设备。
详细情况我们最好能够见面详谈，目前新加坡还没有任何建筑使用类似本项目的器材，如HDB首先采用，对产业的售卖一定会起着正面的作用。您有任何问题可以邮件联系我，或者打我电话：XXXX。
希望能够跟相关负责人见面详谈，谢谢您的帮忙。

Good evening Sir/Madam 
My name is XXXXX and I am the XXXXX. ModuGro Systems is a hydroponics company, with a mission to become the recognized leader in advocating the use of hydroponics in Singapore.
We are looking to integrate our hydroponics system into the newly released build-to-order (BTO) flats. Over the years, there has been a rising trend in younger couples applying for housing. Through this, we want to encourage self-sustainability through our hydroponics system and also to reach Singapore's 30/30 vision in the near future.
ModuGro systems is hoping to work with the government to help Singapore achieve its goals 
Therefore we hope we can work together to help Singapore achieve this dream as well as making sure Singaporeans understands the importance of self-sustainability. 
We are hoping that you can find the time to read and understand our proposal and if there's an interest we can send the relevant documents. Including quotations and we can send in the rendering and how we picture our product in the BTO.Below i have attached documents in regards to my company please have a look.

Enquiry for common area ~ roof top 354
Dear Sir /Mdm
I am writing to make a request for my XXXXX. I noticed that solar panels have been adequately installed for the neighbouring blocks 352 and I am wondering if the same would be done for block 354 too please? If not possible , may I ask why, even though both blocks are four storeys high?
Just so you know, most days, my flat feels extremely warm and humid, and even the tap water is warm/hot to the touch!  So I really hope something can be done to insulate residents of block 354 so that we can enjoy a 'cooler' climate within our flats throughout the year. 
As you know very well- Singapore is very warm and humid for almost the entire year. Unfortunately with global warming and climate change, it can only get worse, not better
I look forward to hear good news from you. 
Sincerely ,
XXXXX

Re: Enquiry for common area ~ roof top 354
Dear sir / mdm
I am appalled at your response and the way HDB and JTC handles queries from residents!
 I wrote to JTC for the same query on Monday 29 june2020,  and they conveniently directed me to HDB . And guess what- now you (HDB) is referring me to JTC??!!??! 
IS THIS A JOKE?! 
Please investigate and tell me who is truly responsible, or should i direct my query to the MP in charge, so he can tell me who to write to instead?
Surely residents do not wish to pay their taxes only to receive such service  from the people 'who care'? 
Sincerely,

","Thank for your request to have solar photovoltaic (PV) panels installed at the rooftop of XXXX.
We would like to share that as part of the national solar PV implementation effort, HDB is leading the whole-of-government SolarNova initiative to implement solar panels on the rooftops of public buildings. On HDB’s end, we have committed to implement around 540MWp by 2030 which we estimate to cover about 70% of all HDB blocks in Singapore. The implementation of solar panels, however, is a large undertaking and we will be rolling out solar panels on the rooftops of HDB blocks in phases.
In assessing the suitability and feasibility of a rooftop, our considerations include having to ensure that there is sufficient space available, and that there is minimal shading as solar panels require sunlight to generate electricity. As such, as you have already observed, not all buildings will be installed with solar panels if they are deemed unfeasible, and hence there will be blocks within estates that may not be installed with solar panels yet.
Nonetheless, with the advancement in solar panel technology, previously unfeasible areas may yet become feasible. We are planning to re-visit the HDB blocks in Jurong-Clementi Town Council, which includes Blk 354 Clementi Ave 2, in one of our future tenders over the next few years, and solar panels will be installed on the rooftop if the roof conditions are subsequently deemed feasible.
Thank you.

Dear Mr Chia,
Thank you for your further queries. Please see our replies as follows:
1) As phase 1 has been completed at Zhenghua, has there been any communications of this and the benefits to residents?
We will publish a Press Release whenever we call a new SolarNova tender at least once a year that gives a general update on the general SolarNova status. We have not done any specific outreach to the residents in Zhenghua regarding the benefits of the solar panel installation. However, we could work with your office on a Zhenghua outreach if that is being explored.
                              EC: Yes please work with our Constituency Director William (copied). It will be good if we can communicate this to our resident. I would like to be able to share this via FB post. Our residents will be keen to know about sustainability initiatives in our town.
2) For the low rise blocks that have not been included, is there a way for us to pilot instead?
It is still preferable that we make use of our SolarNova programme to install solar panels at the yet uninstalled blocks due to economies of scale, and there are plans to do so in the near future. 
Nonetheless regarding the pilot, we note that there are 2 segments regarding the proposal – one on solar panels, and one on wind energy. We would like to better understand the details of the proposal especially on the wind energy segment. If the wind energy segment is deemed feasible, then one possible way forward to facilitate the pilot is:
·         We get our current SolarNova Phase 4 vendor, Sunseap Leasing Pte Ltd, to explore to provide and install the solar panel system at that block through a variation order to the SolarNova Phase 4 contract
·         We’ll link up and facilitate discussions between Sunseap and the SG wind company to integrate both their systems
·         The SG wind company can come in to provide the wind segment of the pilot 
With regards to wind, I do know of a SG company that is keen to pilot this. Can we have an initial discussions with them.
We are happy to discuss further with the company on the feasibility of the wind energy. Could you provide us with their contact so that we may engage them further?
                              EC: Yes please contact Kenneth from Utica at +65 9345 5015.  www.utica.sg

Dear Mr Chia,
I refer to your request for the solar PV installation schedule for Bukit Panjang Town, and your request to allow a pilot project by Temasek Foundation using solar panels and wind turbines in one of the HDB blocks in Senja area.  
HDB’s SolarNova Programme
2            We thank you for your interest in pursuing green initiatives and renewable energy. HDB has been actively driving the implementation of renewable energy through the deployment of solar panels under our SolarNova programme, and we call annual bulk SolarNova tenders for large-scale installation of solar panels on the rooftops of HDB blocks. Under SolarNova, the Solar Leasing model is used where the installation, ownership, operation and maintenance of the solar panel system is covered by the vendor for 20 years. The solar energy generated from the solar panels is sold to the Town Council at a preferential rate and used to power the common services of the HDB block in the day, allowing Town Councils to benefit from savings to their electricity bills. 
3       We are targeting to implement 540MWp of solar panels by 2030, which is estimated to cover about 70% of all HDB blocks. Due to the large scale implementation, we can achieve economies of scale by calling bulk SolarNova tenders, and separate efforts to use individual vendors to install solar PV, especially on a small scale, may end up with higher implementation costs that will reduce the benefits to the Town Council.
Solar Panel installation in Bukit Panjang Town and Zhenghua Division
4       Most of the blocks in Bukit Panjang Town have been identified earlier for solar panel installation under the SolarNova Phase 1 and Phase 4 tenders called by HDB. Blocks under SolarNova Phase 1 have mostly been completed and are in operation, while blocks under SolarNova Phase 4 are in progress and expected to complete in 3Q2021. The blocks that have not been identified for solar panel installation are 4-storey low-rise blocks that were not included in the installation list due to potential shading effects, but there are plans to re-look at such blocks in future SolarNova tenders to maximise PV deployment. The block list is as attached for your reference. 
Solar PV installation in Bukit Panjang Town
Solar PV installation in Zhenghua Division
Request for Pilot Project by Temasek Foundation at one HDB block in Senja Area
5           As most of the blocks under Holland-Bukit Panjang Town Council are slated to be installed with solar panels as part of the SolarNova programme, we regret to inform that we are unable to accede to your request for the pilot project by Temasek Foundation at this point in time. In our earlier studies on wind energy, done together with NTU in 2014, we found that Singapore may not be suitable for harnessing wind energy due to the relatively low wind speeds we are getting, and there is too little wind energy generated from commercial wind turbines for a business case. Nonetheless, we will be happy to discuss this proposal further, to understand the technical aspects of the proposal, and how much energy is expected to be generated to see if it is worth piloting. Thank you.

Feedback DetailUnderstood from TV news that HDB would be evaluating Nippon reflexive paint. I agreed it was a good development to cool the home but I had a concern. Since it is reflexive, does it mean that the heat or sunlight will be reflected away? Will it mean more heat will be put outside the house and onto the road? This will increase the ambient temperature. With increase ambient heat surrounding the residential area, won’t the house get hotter?

The contractor has just resumed last week work stalled due to the virus outbreak and phased in of the ‘circuit breaker’ work restriction.
Some level of noise could be expected from construction work carried out on the rooftop. The Project Engineer has been informed and are aware of the noise generated and have instructed the workers to be mindful of the residents below.
Work has now stopped due to MOM witholding clearance to work to workers until further notice because of recent detection virus infection in some workers dormitories.

Dear Sir, 
We are a Solar Energy Company and our Singapore entity is Ditrolic (S) Pte Ltd within the Ditrolic Group. 
We currently operate a few Solar energy system on our client roof to generate clean energy for our client consumption. 
We understand that Singapore have an open and clear policy for renewable generation and HDB have done such project where excess electricity are exported and serving consumers as off-site generation. 
We are currently in a close door discussion with our client in Singapore to generate such off-site clean energy for their consumption . 
We require an aggregate 100,000msq of existing roof for such off customer site generation and hope your can have such roof to offer, a rental will be paid for such usage. 
Awaits your good feedback on the above mention and please do not hesitate to contact us for further clarifications.
Thanks you.

","Thank you for your inquiry.
As you may be aware, HDB is currently implementing the national SolarNova programme to deploy solar panels on the rooftops of public buildings. Under SolarNova, the Solar Leasing model is used whereby there is no upfront cost of the PV system to HDB, and the PV vendor will own, operate, and maintain the PV system for up to 20 years.
The solar energy generated is used to power the common services of the HDB block in the day, and includes the lights, lifts, and water pumps. The Town Councils managing our estates will purchase this solar energy at a preferential rate, and any excess solar energy is exported to the power grid.
We call bulk SolarNova tenders annually, and the next SolarNova Phase 6 tender is targetted to be called at the end of this year. You may keep a lookout at www.gebiz.gov.sg for the tendering opportunities available.
I can be contacted at XXXX if your require further clarification. Thank you.

All the PV panels wiring around my estate are dangling loosely. Think this is not adhered to code of practice.,"We would like to thank you for sharing your concern on the condition of the solar cables at XXXX
The solar installation in Wellington Circle was originally completed and handed over to the Sembawang Town Council in 2008, as part of a ‘Supply and Install’ contract called by HDB. 
Subsequently, we called a new bulk tender for the supply, operation and maintenance of solar PV (SolarNova Phase 1) in 2017, which was awarded to Sunseap Leasing. They would be taking over the existing solar panels and would be replacing them with a set of higher efficiency solar panels. They are in the process of acquiring new materials to commence work on the new installation.
In the meantime, we have instructed the contractor Sunseap Leasing to tidy up the cables.

Hi XXXXX
Wilson here again.  I am writing in my personal capacity.  
I have attended a couple of the Emerging Stronger Together conversations, but the format of the sessions is prohibitive to share more coherent ideas, and given that I do not know any other platforms to share the views for subsequent brainstorming effectively, here is my humble attempt to reach out to you, and see if the attached insights in pdf are useful, or at least provide some seedlings for further brainstorming for the relevant departments.
Am very keen and willing to participate in any brainstorming sessions as I am passionate in contributing my potentially over-ruminating mind to the economic-restructuring conversations.
Hope it helps.
Sincerest thanks.
Warmest,

Dear XXXX
We sincerely apologize for our late reply.
2.        We have conducted our investigations and the lift shut down was due to the installation of the solar photovoltaic (PV) system on the rooftop of XXXX. As part of the installation procedure, the common area services are required to be shut down temporarily to facilitate the commissioning of the solar PV system.
3.        On 4 Nov 2020, the solar PV contractor (Sembcorp) was commissioning multiple solar PV systems in various blocks on the same day. For Block 15 Teck Whye Lane, the allocated time slot was from 9am to 10am. Prior to the shut down on 4 November 2020, a notification was given to Choa Chu Kang Town Council on 27 Oct 2020 and shutdown notices were placed at the lift lobbies of the 1st floor and other common areas of Block 15 Teck Whye Lane on 28 Oct 2020.
4.        We apologise for the inconvenience caused to you. We will inform the solar PV contractor to be mindful and avoid shutdown during the peak hours to minimise such inconvenience as much as possible. Thank you.

"I am hoping to gather information with regards to the effect of SolarNova Programme on the consumption of fossil fuels for energy, more specifically in the area of Yuhua for my Economics Extended Essay. 
Here is the list of questions I wish to present 
1.) In 2014, it was announced that the HDB blocks in Yuhua would be the first to be implemented with solar panels under the SolarNova programme, why was Yuhua chosen specifically?
2.) How many households are under the SolarNova Programme in Yuhua?
3.) Has the usage of fossil fuels for electricity in the HDB blocks been reduced since the start of the SolarNova programme? Could you give me a rough percentage? 
4.) Other than the SolarNova programme, what other measures have been implemented or in the pipe in Yuhua to reduce carbon emissions in the area?
5.) Are all households in the 29 Yuhua blocks under the SolarNova Programme required to be on board the SolarNova Programme? 
6.) Does the HDB block rely completely on solar energy instead of fossil fuels?
7.) What is your take on this SolarNova project�s impact on Yuhua so far, has it benefited residents? 
8.) How has carbon emissions been reduced in the area since the start of the programme?
9.) Is it possible in the near future, that all HDB blocks in Yuhua rely fully on solar energy as a renewable source of energy?
","Thanks for your interest in our SolarNova programme. My responses are appended.
You can reach out to me at XXXX if you have any other question.
1.) In 2014, it was announced that the HDB blocks in Yuhua would be the first to be implemented with solar panels under the SolarNova programme, why was Yuhua chosen specifically?
To guide the development of sustainable initiatives for existing towns, HDB launched the HDB Greenprint programme in 2012 to study an integrated approach of implementing eco-friendly features in existing towns. Yuhua was selected as the pilot neighbourhood of HDB Greenprint to assess the performance, viability, effectiveness and residents’ level of acceptance. The implementation of solar panels was one of the strategies adopted under HDB Greenprint to drive energy sustainability, which ran concurrently with the slew of sustainability initiatives under HDB Greenprint. Greenprint_Yuhua has since completed in 2015 and was well received by the residents.
To clarify, the HDB blocks in Yuhua were not the first blocks to be implemented with solar panels under the SolarNova programme.
2.) How many households are under the SolarNova Programme in Yuhua?
The rooftops of 29 blocks in Yuhua were installed with solar panels. The solar energy generated is used to power the common services of the blocks, which include the lights, lifts, and water pumps. Excess solar energy is exported to the power grid.
Due to policy limitations, households are unable to purchase the solar energy generated directly, and were hence not involved in the SolarNova programme. Instead, the Town Councils purchase the generated solar energy that powers the common services at a preferential rate that is not higher than prevailing energy tariff rates, which help to mitigate rising maintenance costs to indirectly benefit the residents.
3.) Has the usage of fossil fuels for electricity in the HDB blocks been reduced since the start of the SolarNova programme? Could you give me a rough percentage?
The solar energy harnessed is used to power common services in the HDB estates like lifts, lighting in common areas and pumps, helping town councils to moderate increases in operating and maintenance costs due to inflation. We estimate about a 30% reduction in the consumption of electricity from conventional energy sources, i.e. 30% of the block energy common services energy consumption is provided by solar energy.
4.) Other than the SolarNova programme, what other measures have been implemented or in the pipe in Yuhua to reduce carbon emissions in the area?
The HDB Greenprint_Yuhua has achieved the following in Yuhua:
	a reduction in common area energy consumption, e.g. through Solar PV, outdoor LED;
	water savings through rainwater harvesting system; and
	a reduction in ambient temperature through rooftop greenery.
5.) Are all households in the 29 Yuhua blocks under the SolarNova Programme required to be on board the SolarNova Programme?
The households are not required to be on board, as the households are not directly involved (see no. 2).
6.) Does the HDB block rely completely on solar energy instead of fossil fuels?
In general the solar energy generated is only sufficient to meet the daytime common services needs of the HDB block. The rest of the energy needs are met by drawing electricity from the power grid.
7.) What is your take on this SolarNova projectï¿½s impact on Yuhua so far, has it benefited residents?
See no. 1 and 5.
8.) How has carbon emissions been reduced in the area since the start of the programme?
In general, 1 kWh of solar energy generated reduces CO2 emissions by 0.5kg. Therefore, solar energy generated from the solar panels on the rooftop of a HDB block can help reduce carbon emissions.
9.) Is it possible in the near future, that all HDB blocks in Yuhua rely fully on solar energy as a renewable source of energy?
There are limits on the number of solar panels that can be installed on a HDB rooftop. For now, the solar panels on HDB rooftops are sufficient to cover the common services of the HDB blocks. With the advances in solar PV technology, it might be possible one day that a significant portion of a block’s energy needs are met by solar energy.

Dear XXXXX
Thank you for your support for the Government’s drive to promote a more sustainable transport sector and low-carbon future for Singapore.
On your suggestion to increase the generation and deployment of solar energy, you may be aware that the HDB and EDB have launched the SolarNova programme since 2014 to aggregate demand from various government agencies, to enjoy economies of scale. LTA is among the agencies participating in the latest tender under the SolarNova programme, for the installation of solar panels at various locations islandwide, including HDB estates and government sites.
As public carparks are owned and managed by HDB and URA, we have shared your feedback and suggestions with HDB and URA for their attention as well.
We wish you a pleasant day.
Yours sincerely

Dear Sir
I’m glad that MTO is strongly promoting the use of  electric car. Do agreed this will lower the emission of CO2.
I believe the authority can further contribute to green by using renewal energy. My suggestion is to mandate all open carpark must have carport with solar enable. Further more the rest of the roofing be solar enable.  As solar is a viable renewal energy and solar depend on area/space. Instead of just allow an open carpark is not economical to the nation.
This will further assist the government to achieve their goal. 
Based on Google :: Transport accounts for around one-fifth of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions [24% if we only consider CO2 emissions from energy].
HDB is doing their part and the rest of the agency too.
Climate change is a huge problem.
Thank you

","Thank you for your suggestion to have all open carparks installed with solar panels.
As you may be aware, HDB is leading the SolarNova programme where we aggregate solar photovoltaic (PV) demand across the public sector to implement solar panels on public buildings. The objective is to maximise the amount of solar energy generated in Singapore to help in energy sustainability.
One of the main considerations in installing solar panels is on the effects of shading. As solar panels require sunlight to generate solar energy, any shading experienced would significantly reduce the amount of solar energy harnessed. This will increase the cost of implementation as less solar energy is generated.
In general, open air carparks in HDB estates experience shading from the surrounding tall blocks, as well as from greenery such as trees. This adds to the challenge on implementing solar panels as the solar energy generated might not be able to offset the cost of the solar panel system. Nonetheless, we are constantly working with the PV industry to explore means to further maximise the solar energy generation.
Thank you.

Thank you for your email dated 14 Dec 2020. 
I certainly appreciate your reply to me. Please allow me to clarify on the 2nd paragraph which I had extracted below:
In response to your request, we are sorry that we are unable to accede your request using the sliding cloth hanger system as there is a possibility that they can fall from your flat. Objects falling from a flat can cause serious injury or death to passers-by below your flat.
I had highlighted in yellow, this sentence gives me the impression that the sliding hangar can fall from my flat. With this impression, if I seek advice from an HDB approved contractor, will this help with your concern? 
As for the solar panels, there are a couple of ways I can hang or mount the panels onto the sliding hanger. Panels will be held in place by several mountings, not just one. A secondary attachment system can also be put in place to ensure that the possibilities of a panel dropping is eradicated. As the system is retractable, periodic checks can be done easily.
With more of us working from home, energy cost is a key concern. Being a citizen, I also wish to contribute to the green effort which is the talk of today. Thus, I look forward to seeking your assistance to help me make my environment friendlier and cheaper to live in too. Thank you.

"Dear Mr Ng,
Season greetings to you. Happy Winter Solstice Festival.
I am happy to receive your mail dated 18 Dec 2020.  Please allow me to share my thoughts and suggestions further with you, in reference to your paragraph and my thoughts in brackets below.
HDB is fully supportive of the harnessing of clean energy sources. In fact, HDB has been leading a nationwide programme since 2015, which aims to maximise solar panels on public buildings. HDB has also committed to at least 540MWp of solar panels by 2030, estimated to cover 70% of HDB blocks. The solar energy that is generated will be used to power the common services of the block, leading to utility bill savings to the Town Council which helps to mitigate rising maintenance costs, and indirectly benefitting the residents as a whole.
(I am glad to hear HDB is fully supportive of clean energy. I must say it�s a great job for the community. With your support, I believed we can do more together to obtain direct savings to the monthly electricity bill at home).
 In response to your request   suggestion. We wish to share that the clothes drying rack were not built for such a purpose and load. 
(The overhead cloth hanger is an idea to use the little space in my 4 room flat. Solar technology will continue to improve, smaller, lighter, more efficient and easier to handle too. The panel I will use panel may not be heavier in weight than the wet blankets, kilts and other thick clothes add together). 
This will also make it difficult for home owners to maintain their installations and ensure their safety over time.
(1.	Safety is in my mind too. I am confident with your help we can manage this.
(2.	Firstly, anyone who wishes to install solar panels will need to seek your approval just like what I am doing now, exploring the possibility with you.
(3.	Installations can only be carried out by approved contractors for both the sliding frame and the solar system.
(4.	Solar aircon system installed must show at least an acceptable savings in carbon emission.
(5.	Lastly you can make it mandatory that check and inspection tasks be included in the quarterly service carried out by the aircon / solar service agent)
The gradual wearing of the parts and a sudden strong gust of wind catching the panel will cause it to fling downstair. 
(1.	Yes, I agree that parts will wear as it�s a sliding system. That is where I had suggested quarterly inspection as above.
(2.	With the appropriate design and mounting this �fear� of panels flying off can be eradicated).
This could lead to an issue of the killer litter with age, causing injury or even death to passers-by below.
(1.	Just like you, I am truly aware of this hazard. To ensure that the panels do not get disengaged, there are several options such as using specific industrial tape in addition to multiple mountings screws at multiple points. 
(2.	Additionally, a secondary cable attachment can also be introduced to ensure that the panels will not fall out completely). 
The panels protruding out of the fa�ade of the block, marring the look and feel of the building with unsightly, irregular projections if were installed by individual flat owners. 
(We already have a unique look from the way we hang the clothes. As this is above the current cloth hanging frame that HDB had already installed, specifying your requirements for the solar installations will provide guidance and discipline for those who wish to use the sun energy).   
We seek your understanding in this matter.
(1.	As a retiree I am hoping to stretch my dollar in every way. 
(2.	Renewable energy and sustainability is a topic of today. My aim is to explore with your help to tap nature at our doorstep. 
(3.	To start, perhaps you can let me know your cardinal requirements so that I can try to work towards it. 
(4.	I do not wish to be a burden to you. My hope is to find a win-win solution together with you.
(5.	Thank you once again for your kind attention). 
Merry Christmas.

Hi XXXXX
Thanks for your email. Your responses are valid. Let me explain why we needed your contact details. 
When we received your feedback for the posters, our aim is to fix the problem immediately but we were not able to pinpoint the location and additional time and resources were required to go through all the lift lobbies to check for posters.
In your first email, you have also mentioned that the area and neighbourhood as been neglected. This is an important piece of information and we should fix this. 
As different zones have different contractors and different blocks have different cleaning staff, location details would allow us to conduct an analysis of the issue and better determine if it was a process, training or personnel issue. 
In your second email, you have also mentioned about the walking path filled with plants and soy milk stores. Could we get more information on this so that we know the exact location to better understand the situation and see how we can rectify this?

Good afternoon,
Thank you for your response.
The followings are points which I would like to highlight and I do hope you and your team look into it:
1) there was a change of attitude in your email after I decline to provide my details. Your response on 17th Aug 2020 made me felt that I’m treated like a keyboard warrior whereby my intention was to help out my neighbourhood.
2) there was no updates until I email you with Jurong GRC in the CC loop on 14th Aug 2020. Obviously I would like to have a follow up. 
3) “ And for the last 3 weeks, town council and RC members have been working tirelessly to fix a multitude issues that have been surfacing with specifics. The staff and contractors have been working tirelessly to fix numerous issues. They have also fulfilled hundreds of specific request since and helping to make improvements. ” this part of the response, arent you and your team suppose to do? Your response towards me was irritating, are you trying to tell me that I am asking the obvious question?
4) lastly I will continue to feedback as I believe it is Jurong GRC team duty to serve and at least maintain the area.
Have a good day!

Good morning Mr Shawn and team,
Hope all is well.
I will not share more details until I see improvement in my area. It has been a week since I share my concern with you and the team however there is no changes/improvement. The issue I brought up wasn't hard to understand and honestly it was very straight forward. If you and your team has the effort to walk around you will be able to notice (I have checked a few blocks have the same issue). 
Honestly speaking there are so many areas to improve, for example the walking path before the dry market. The plants and soya milk stores are taking up the walking path (from what I understand they are even RC members). In fact I am skeptical about how sincere is Jurong GRC. 
Anyway I hope you and your team have a good day.

Subject: Singapore - the solar city
Dear Minister,  
I am XXXXX, an active advocate and technology provider for building applied PV (BAPV). Please allow me to share some of my sincere thoughts with you.
As climate change evolve into a climate crisis, does Singapore has an uniquely sustainable icon to show our commitment for a sustainable future?. 
Yes indeed. In fact Singapore has HDB and HDB is a perfect media to transform Singapore in a signature “Solar City” by applying colorful solar cladding into its expansive façade surfaces. This is a new architectural concept known as solar architecture which I teach at NUS and BCA Academy. 
You may be aware that Singapore already has a national roadmap for deploying PV on the facades. According to this study,  façade applied BAPV will account for more than 50% of our national target of 1.5 GW by 2025.  This a largely untapped solar sector which presents the best opportunity for Singapore. It  need to be addressed very soon under the accelerated  program with currently available technology.
How to appreciate the value of building applied PV on façade (façade BAPV)?.
Singapore is very far behind most other countries in land, sea and roof mounted PV. Façade BAPV may be the only chance for Singapore  to distinguish ourself among the PV advanced countries. Singapore Solar City is a vision to propel Singapore into the world map for sustainable design. Façade BAPV in our HDB estate will provide a visual motivation for all of us to stand together as SG United against climate crisis. It has the making of our next national icon. It may attract solar tourism to Singapore. Events like the upcoming WEF will be a good forum to showcase our BAPV.
Façade BAPV is a 2in1 multi functional building material. It is used as an insulating cladding material to improve the indoor comfort of residents right behind the gable end wall. Given that the threshold of 1.5C increase in temperature will be very reached sooner, installing and insulating the wall condition for our residents, may be an imperative rather than a option. Façade BAPV is engineered  to generate sufficient solar energy to pay for the whole cost of the solar  façade cladding system. , This is a claim that can be supported by independent studies conducted  by SERIS and NUS. With the proposed solar city concept, Singapore is capable of meeting several  national objectives in a single solution. They are:
a) to promote indoor comfort for residents, 
b) to reduce the UHI effect for the environment  
c) to increase solar power generation for carbon reduction.  
By  using façade BAPV as the only building material that can pay for its whole  cost, whatever capital expenditure that will be spent initially can be fully recovered within 15-18 years or lesser.. With a service life of most PV panels at no less than 40 years, this would means Singapore’s Solar City project,  can at certain point of time, enjoy totally cost-free cladding and also cost-free solar energy from our facades for more than 20 years thereafter. It is indeed an all-value proposal no easily found with other sustainable design options.
The colourful solar panels can be recycled and even relocated at will with easy installation system.
The colored PV modules has been register with SCDF under the product listing scheme and it is being accepted  and installed at PSA Tuas Mega Port, as the first super low energy building deploying façade BAPV. 
Pre-requites for façade BAPV and solar architecture
For any PV to be used for façade decoration and to promote the concept of solar architecture,  it shall be built with strong architectural appeal in term of offering various imaginative colors beyond the traditional black. It may be useful to note that black wall surface promote urban heat island effect, which is contradictory to our national effort for sustainable design.
For the colorful PV to be effective as a façade BAPV, it must also perform to the highest efficiency, as close as possible to the black. Today’s colored PV technology has reach a high efficiency of more than 17% , almost as efficient as the traditional  black.
      It follow therefore that high efficiency colored BAPV, provide the best technological and architectural solutions for Singapore to evolve in a world’s first solar city.
.
Dear Minister, 
Kindly refer to a 2-page slides for better understanding of our proposal. 
      I shall be very happy to provider further information as required.
      Have a nice day ahead.

It is nice to receive your mail dated today 28 Dec 2020.
If the cloth hanger is not allowed, I shall not drill anything on the ceiling.
In this case, my suggestion will be an indoor frame/floor-mounted system which I can open the lightweight solar panels upward. This will be done with 2 pieces the length of the ""gala pole "", and width to my balcony windows, similar to spreading my blanket to the sun. This will be another great option too. I can easily deploy and retract whenever I want. Hope to share more if needed.

","Thank you for your feedback on the solar panel installation works at XXXX and its vicinity.
The solar panel installation end date of 19 Feb 2021 as indicated in the notices was the initial estimate of the completion date of the solar panel installation on the rooftop of the blocks. However, due to downtime caused by unpredictable weather which delayed installation works, the completion date has been revised to a later date. The revised notices with be placed at the notice boards to keep residents informed of the installation works.
The cordoned off areas on the ground floor are based on the rooftop locations that will be installed with solar panels. For Blk 234, there were rooftop installation works taking place near the edge of the rooftop, hence the ground floor area was cordoned off. For Blk 236, the installation works took place further inwards away from the rooftop edge, hence there was no ground floor cordoned off area. The rooftops are still provided with perimeter fencing for both blocks regardless for the safety of the workers and the general public.
We have requested the solar panel contractor to review the current measures to minimise noise during installation works. We seek your understanding that some noise and inconvenience will be present while the installation works are ongoing.
The workers only work from Monday to Saturday during office hours, and do not work during weekends and public holidays. We have requested for them to minimise works during the Chinese New Year period to 26 Feb 2021 as mentioned in your feedback.
I hope this helps to clarify your concerns on the solar panel installations. I may be contacted at XXXX if you require further clarification. Thank you.

Feedback DetailHi
I noted the government's push to go green.
I too am trying to do my part and have installed solar panels at my home.
Why does the government not provide any subsidies for private home owners for the installation of solar panels? Singapore has large amounts of sunshine all through the year. A quick look at landed and low rise estates will show that solar panels hardly exist on any of the roofs of individual homes/condos and this presents an untapped opportunity.
For citizens who install solar panels, could the government consider paying owners more for the export of electricity? This would encourage home owners to install solar panels, which can be prohibitive in terms of up front cost, and contribute to the national grid. 
Right now we only receive $0.1599 or $0.1532 per kWh.
For import, we pay $0.2143 or $0.2076 per kWh.
Best regards

Dear XXXXXX
Picking up the key messages from your post on LinkedIn. 
“our plans to build public housing in prime locations like the city centre and Greater Southern Waterfront.
Left to the market, these prime areas would likely be used for exclusive housing developments that only the well-off can afford, given their attractive locations. 
social and economic forces that can divide communities, and ensure that these prime areas continue to reflect the openness and diversity of our society.
include public rental housing for low income families. We will also introduce a new housing model, so new HDB flats in these areas remain affordable for young families and Singaporeans of all backgrounds.
We need to do this for cohesion, because we only have our one city. It is a balancing act”
I take the liberty of writing to you to introduce our services in Singapore and offer few suggestions to be considered as part of your development creative consulting team. Our company, MadsignLife: Made to Design life in Assimilation mode to embrace future-proofing.
Focus to look for projects to support transformation and sustainable climate solutions and all green related in the build and live environment. Our Sustainable approaches to design from past and present, Relational building + location with energy rationalisation will achieve maximum energy savings with latest technology and innovative green materials as well as pushing for identifying untapped existing resources for long lasting results.
Energy Modeling and Thermal, Daylight, and Acoustical Analysis either as part of our Environmental Engineering consulting or as an individual service. Our data interpretation and result oriented solution comes with many years of experience and substantial past projects to achieve maximum desired results.
Madsignlife in Singapore is a partnership between an Environmental Engineering architect Thomas Austerveil and myself please see attached past projects aad presentation. Including Environmental Engineering(EE) information.
We propose to create an autonomous cluster where people’s concern are how to live sustainably and purposefully understanding the meaning of community sharing, green material for climate change as modern solution that is trendy and contemporary future looking rather than lifestyle comparing size of cars or marble in the house. With EV push, perhaps one of the criteria to live in this community is to commit to own a EV vehicle by move-in time especially for certain GREEN Model blocks - middle income family. During design and build period we can showcase the work in progress showing how this sustainable living space will reduce C02. We can support to share interactive knowledge how the EE solutions will greatly support climate change and carve out the best way to live sustainably for the current growing interest for more information in this area. 
We propose to alleviate hard tech solutions for rainwater collection - desalination, biodigester to create bio-fuel for some blocks or whole cluster if it makes financial sense after a complete study. We can introduce solar cooling shelter for play and activity grounds/ radiative cooling system in the home which uses half the energy without aircon air, and battery storage with very short term ROI of 3-5 years. We suggest to charge the initial investment to the high end exclusive housing (we can pitch the benefits by using Environmental Engineering where more comfort and anti-pollution solution (PMI, humidity, hot sun and sound pollution will be addressed) as the true meaning of new luxury living plus super prime location will be charged at much higher premium so we can design subsidies funding lower cost housing sharing the alleviated hard tech facilities to reduce and lower monthly living expenses for the lower income group. 
We would also seek government support at a lower cost for us to offer free interior design service to source for low cost good quality green material and furniture to help the low cost housing to setup a well-designed long lasting home where the owner will be proud owning as well as living purposefully understanding the meaning of HDB green living well. And be actively participating in Singapore Green Plan 2030 – we can introduce arty recycling bins – create new green jobs for the people who live in the neighbourhood to reduce commute carbon footprint and commit to the care and involvement of the community living – a new green city village where everyone cares.
For the community share living, we have ideas to use bus-stops as meeting the regulars, pickup and move with Singapore snacks food-market gathering and knowing your neighbours. 
As we are close to Haw Paw Villa and Sentosa, having tourist-local bus route for tourist to see how Singapore Green Living and experience local green-life by visiting the F B or activity area before or after Sentosa or Haw Paw Villa  – if the Transport Government is interested we have also solution for Hydrogen bus, and with the maintenance facility investment transport Trucks between Singapore and Malaysia can be included all the way to Jurong and Tuas. Both Hydrogen Bus and Trucks are already available in China. Only perhaps if tourist /double decker bus may need some designing to custom for Singapore perhaps painting in Green-Red-White (seek an art school collab to work with this) as our Singapore Green Message. A good opportunity prevail itself to develop a evolve Singapore life in the form of art and culture.
This is a high level of ideas and what we have been working for last 7 years - I believe our contribution can propose a detail feasible and executable plan with our global resources to create a modal mini circular sustainable climate saving green economy with this project.
 Please see attached reference projects and link for Environmental Engineering (EE) lecture my partner share at Tongji University in Shanghai. By doing environmental study we can create effective and targeted solutions with interesting down to earth meaningful and relevant stories to link a Build and Live Mission to fully embrace SG Green Plan 2030
https://www.dropbox.com/s/7e3gku72b2i6ble/GASP_Lecture_AAD.pdf?dl=0
We like to take the opportunity to introduce this fast connection to increase productivity by 50%, with zero waste on site. We can also present a new innovative proven success story using desert sand for green cement for precast build.

Urgent
Confidential   for Addressee Only.
Dear XXXXXX
Attached 3 photographs taken at about 1.42pm, 5.05pm, 6pm having more excessively loud noisy machine noises.
Please refer to several calls to NEA, CCKTC   HDB seeking assistance to reduce Noise Pollution of excessive loud working/welding machine noise at HDB Rooftop for Solar Panel System work at XXXXXX, that much affecting to Residents at large, especially Residents residing at upper level.
NEA   HDB responded under CCKTC purview. While calling to CCKTC Hotline Officer, Ms XXXXXX insisted to escalate to CCKTC Manager in charge, Mr XXXXXX who could not deter or assist to reduce the Noise Pollution, but permit the Contractor to continue their Noisy Work even after 6pm.
Beside, after feedback this morning, thereafter even more excessive loud from the Rooftop Workers' work. Our Family tried to call CCKTC   HDB again, CCKTC Manager in charge   the Contractor were ignoring our feedback, to continue the even more excessive loud working/welding machine noise at Rooftop for Solar Panel Work. Our Family called to CCKTC EMSU after 5pm, that HDB advise no noisy work after 5.30pm, even EMSU also could not deter the Contractor still refuse   continue even after 6pm. HDB responded CCKTC should able to handle the feedback, but in vain.
The Solar Panel Work at Rooftop of XXXXXX facing the Bin Centre, had been completed and the Contractor had moved on to the same block facing the Keat Hong LRT.  But this morning, returning to the same block facing the Bin Centre for One Whole Day more excessively loud Working/ Welding Machine Noise without any preventive measure.
Could Ms Fu look into NEA   HDB Hotline and NEA   HDB Officer in charge did not provide any Noise Pollution Device to read the Noise Decibel   provide any stop work order and No Enforcement Action/Disciplinary Action on CCKTC as Managing Agent purview, as did not provide any Preventive Measure for Noise Pollution that much affecting to Public Health   Environment Issues? NEA Officer had advised that any hearing loss is permanent, but under CCKTC purview did not provide possible preventive measure for Noise Pollution.
Please look into   possible enforcement action on CCKTC Management, Hotline, Ms Syaz   Manager in charge Mr Chai's lapse in duty   absence of Public Health   Environment issues.
With the few days/weeks continuing of Noisy Work from HDB Rooftop and CCKTC keep relying on CCKTC Manager, Mr Chai who could not take care the issues, could Ms Fu review for possible stop work arrangement for the HDB Rooftop Solar Panel Work/Welding Machine Work that their more excessively loud noisy works daily at XXXXXX   Keat Hong LRT are much affecting to the Residents at large   opposite Palm Gardens, Bus Stops along Choa Chu Kang Way at proximity.
Please also look into no respond from CCKTC Senior Manager, Mr Chai's Superior, for months also did not respond on there is no Solar Panel Work atXXXXXXopposite Palm Gardens, while the rest of HDB Blocks at proximity already having   installed Rooftop Solar Panel System.
Please receive with high confidentiality of the above contents   not to forward to non-addressee and not to forward to NEA or CCKTC without our acknowledgement, to deter much repercussion upon general feedback?
Look forward to hear from you soon.

","           Please refer to your feedback on solar works at XXXX
2.        The solar pv installation at XXXX Central is under HDB solar deployment programme along with other blocks uin the vicinity. The work involves many phases mainly hoisting of materials, construction of the pv support structure and PV, electrical and cabling works and lastly connecting of the solar pv system to the power grid network.All these works involves different set of workers specialising in their field.
3.        The construction at Blk 237 is now undergoing electrical cabling works on the roof and later cabling connection to the main switchroom. The major part of construction on the roof has been completed. Resident should expect some noise through the cutting of trunkings during this phase. The contractor, SembCorp Solar Pte Ltd is close to completing the construction in this month of April 2021.
4.        Thank you.

Solar Panels on Roofs
Dear Officer-in-Charge,
We are doing a Sustainable project research. So would like to check with the Officer in charge for the solar panels installed at the roof.
Would solar panels be installed on all the roofs (as long as the area is big enough) or would it be installed on buildings that has reached a certain age? How about new BTO blocks?
Thank you for the clarification.

","HDB and EDB have been co-leading the SolarNova Programme since 2015, which aims to maximise the installation of solar panels on public buildings, including HDB blocks.
In general, there are a few considerations for installation of solar panels on HDB rooftops, such as available rooftop space, shading effects etc. Increasingly, there is space constraint due to competing needs for rooftop space, and we need to balance between providing for essential services (e.g. water tanks, M E plant room, telco equipment) and other uses like solar panels.
For installing solar panels, we do not select based on age of blocks, and our main criterion is available rooftop space and the solar potential of the blocks.
Please let me know if you need more info. You can contact me directly at XXXXX.
Thank you.

Ms Tan feedback that her next block HDB housing estate there is some upgrading  installation work going on to install solar panel.  The noise level is high.
Wants officer to check on the noise level.  Thanks.","           Please refer to your feedback on construction noise at XXXXX and nearby HDB blocks.
2.        As with all construction, some levels of noise generated may be unavoidable. The contractor and sub-contractor have dedicated team performing different task and phase of construction for the whole vicinity. This is to complete the works in the different blocks in within short space of time. In order to maximize the roof space, HDB and our contractor is installing solar panels to the building edge. This requires putting up permanent safety barricade for safety of personnel accessing the rooftop in future, A lot of drilling works is required to put the barricade
3.       All major construction of solar panels on the rooftop at Blk 237 and nearby HDB blocks has been completed. Remaining works left to be completed is the electrical cabling works to the switchroom at Blk 237 and installation of solar panels on low-rise HDB Block which involve different method of installation.

"Will you consider solar panels on the new construction shelter lots at rooftop carpark. It can power the entire carpark lighting. Cctv. Lift, gantry system etc for blk 716A carpark ","Dear XXXXX
Thank you for your suggestion for HDB to consider the rooftop of the multi-storey carpark at XXXXX for installation of solar panels.
As part of the whole-of-government SolarNova initiative, HDB has committed to implementing 540MWp of solar panels on HDB rooftops by 2030. As such, we are constantly exploring the feasibility of maximising solar panels at different parts of HDB towns and estates, including the rooftop of multi-storey carparks. Some of the technical considerations for solar panels include the available space, the amount of sunlight and shading that the solar panels would experience throughout the day, and the relevant structural and fire safety requirements for a safe installation.
Multi-storey carparks is one area that we are looking to include in our solar panel implementation, if deemed feasible and sustainable.

Hi, pls refer to attached photos. Every morning, the sunlight reflects from the solar panel. 
Sometimes i forgot and turn around, my eyes hurt when it reflects directly into my eyes which causes few seconds of blackout.
Probably can have something to cover etc.. i actually closed the windows but still doesnt help. This has been causing inconvenience to my family..

etc.
Could Mr Lee advise any Remedial   Preventive Measures from HDB Solar Panel System Project
at XXXXXX? If HDB   Solar Panel Company could not provide any
Remedial Action in shortest times possible, could Mr Lee look into Removing or Reducing
the Number of Solar Panel for Blk 237 Rooftop as there are several Blocks that having Higher

painting work on metal poles could not resolved the Glaring Problem or Contractor refuse
to provide prompt action on the actual issues, but keep taking their times to paint other
Metal Poles as upset with Residents Feedback. Manager Jesse stated Blk 237 Work had been
Done, but Blk 237 Rooftop facing Keat Hong LRT, still with Hoarding, with incomplete Work,
without any respond.
There is no HDB Officers look into Blk 236 CCK Ctrl Spot Light glaring in the night till todate.

","We note that you have written in previously regarding the glare you are experiencing from the solar panel installation at XXXXX. I understand my colleague, XXXXX, had previously tried to work with the Town Council to request for an address from you to ascertain the location that you are experiencing the glare, but was unsuccessful due to insufficient information regarding your location. As such, based on the pictures that you had sent in, the relevant metal poles were painted black to reduce the glare. However, in your return feedback, you mentioned that this measures was insufficient.
As glare is a subjective matter, where different people in different locations will have different experiences, such information on your location is necessary to help us pinpoint the issue accurately and help address the glare issue that you mentioned you have been experiencing.
Please assist us to help you by providing the location that you are experiencing the glare from. We have also raised the spot light issue at XXXXX to the Town Council for their attention.

"Hi XXXXXXXXXXXX
The technology is direct heat from Sun, for entire district heating, cooking, hot water supply, aquaculture to desalination and much more. 
This  will give energy cost as 20-30 euros per MWH th. the best in Europe at present is 60 - 135 US$  My tech will be cheapest on the planet and that too with a less space requirement almost 1/3rd of P.V and CSP.
I can transmit Suns direct heat by array of lenses (their focal points) to any area requiring heat, for processing in matrix form. 
Consider the technology as a flexible hose 50 cm in diameter with 2-5 MWh thermal heat at the end and the temperature 800 - 1000 degree Celsius. The efficiency is 85-90 % till the end, which could run in Kilometre also.
This can be utilised for any industrial process where heat is required.
Brine desalination with zero discharge and only salt as residue for further mineral extraction. 
I recently got approval for a pilot project in Sohar Port Oman for 100 KW system. They just need a 30 x 30 cm plate with 800 degree Celsius and 100 KWh thermal heat on the plate.
Kindly let me know what you think..
Regards 
XXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXX","Thank you for the email. We have a few questions about your proposed technology.
Based on my understanding, you are proposing to install an array of lenses on our HDB rooftops that will concentrate the Sun’s heat onto one end of your 50cm diameter flexible hose equipment. The other end of your flexible hose equipment will be able to retain 85% to 90% of the captured heat energy, generating 2-5 MW at a temperature of 800-1000 Celsius?
	Can the heat energy collected be converted to electricity?
	800-1000 Celsius is an extremely high temperature that may not be suitable for residential environments. Has there been any consultation / discussion done with SCDF on fire safety requirements?
	HDB currently does not supply any hot water or cooking fuels to households. Do you have any other potential use cases to suggest for HDB developments?
Do correct me if my current understanding is incorrect, and also do send us any available product brochures / technical reports / data / studies done on your proposed technology for a better understanding. We might be keen to explore further if there are good potential use cases for HDB residential developments.
Thank you.
",1139,1170
"Yes you are right but the heat is only at the beginning and at the end and it can reach 1 GWh th also at the end.  I intended this  for Tengah future city project. Desalination of sea water is also one of the avenues. See I shall provide the immense heat and power in one location. say 1x 1  meter area at a cost of 20 USD / MWh thermal heat. How and when to utilize it further is the prerogative of the client or end user. Desalination, district heating, cooling by adsorbtion, aquaculture and ofcourse creating steam and generating electricity via turbine and generator.","Thank you for the email._x000D_
Based on what you have described so far, we are of the opinion that your technology is more suitable for industrial/ commercial applications and processes. However we can meet up with you via Zoom to find out more about your product and see if there are any potential applications for HDB residential environments._x000D_
Do let me have a few possible dates/time if you would like to make a presentation to us._x000D_

","We refer to your feedback received on 31 May 2021 on the glare issue experienced from your unit in the vicinity of XXXXX
2             After we received your initial feedback of glare on 13 Apr 2021, we have worked with our solar panel contractor to understand your concern and explore solutions that may address your glare  concerns. Our staff have also personally gone down to XXXXX, and the surrounding locations, multiple times to try to understand the level of glare that you might be experiencing based on the photos that you had sent to us.
3             As explained, glare is subjective, and in order for us to better understand the glare situation that you are experiencing, we had requested for a joint inspection at your address. This is particularly important as your feedback on such glare is new to HDB, and has not been reported in other block/estates with solar panels installed on their roofs. We note that both the HDB and Town Council have made multiple attempts to arrange a joint inspection at your home, but we are unable to do so because you have not shared your address with us.
4             Based on the limited information available, we had initially instructed our solar panel contractor to use low reflectance paint to paint over the segments of the solar panel structure that was bright according to the picture you submitted on 13 Apr 2021. Subsequently, following your recent feedback from 29 Apr 2021, we have gotten the contractor to paint most segments of the metallic structure that might be facing your unit with low reflectance paint.  Our staff did not notice any glare from the roof of the block throughout the above observation period, both before and after the paint works.
5             Based on the information provided, we have taken the necessary and appropriate measures to address the glare concern that you had reported. Hence,  we seek your understanding that this will be our last reply to you on this matter.

Hi
At 4.30pm today, I spotted two workers working on the roof of XXXXXXXXXXXX despite the heavy rain and lightning. This is a serious work hazard. 
Appreciate it if the town council could inform the contractor to be mindful of their workers’ safety and avoid such incidents in future.
Thank you.

","Dear XXXXX
We thank you for your interest in pursuing green initiatives and renewable energy. 
HDB has been actively deploying solar panels under our SolarNova programme. Under this programme, we call annual bulk SolarNova tenders for large-scale installation of solar panels on the rooftops of HDB blocks. The SolarNova programme also enables Town Councils to enjoy solar energy at a lower cost, due to economies of scale.
Having achieved our earlier solar target of 220 MWp, HDB had, in 2019 announced a new solar target of 540 MWp by 2030. This new target could potentially generate 648 GWh of green energy annually, contributing towards the national solar targets of 1.5 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2025, and 2 GWp by 2030 as set out under the Singapore Green Plan. It is also in line with the HDB Green Towns Programme to harness green energy and bring sustainable living to all HDB towns. 
You can reach me at XXXXX if you require more information.
Thank you.

May i check is this the new way to test whether internal electrical panel are waterproof? By not closing the door to the electrical panel?
Because, there was a heavy rain today, 13 Jun 2021, between 0300H to 0500H.
Btw, is fire extinguisher suppose to be exposed to the elements? Because, from the photo, it is directly exposed to sun   rain.
Thank you.

Inquiry regarding solar panels on HDB roofs
Dear Sir/Madam, 
We are XXXXXXXXXXXX from XXXXXXXXXXXX (Secondary), a team of 3 students (XXXXXXXXXXXX) participating in the National Robotics Competition (NRC) 2021. We are currently researching solar panels on the top of HDB roofs. However, we were unable to find the information required on the HDB website. As such, we would like to enquire some of the details:
1.	What are the dimensions of each solar panel found on HDB buildings?
2.	How much solar energy does each solar panel generate on an average sunny day?
3.	Are there any specific guidelines that HDB follows when adding features to the solar panels (such as one is not allowed to add anything at all; things that are added must fit within a certain size requirement; etc.)?
Thank you for taking time to read this email. We look forward to receiving your reply.
Yours sincerely,
XXXXXXXXXXXX

","Dear XXXXX
Thank you for your interest in solar panels. 
You asked about the dimensions of each solar panel on HDB buildings. Solar panels typically come in two configurations, 60-cell (around 1.6m x 1m) and 72-cell (around 2m x 1m). We do not specify which configuration to use, as long as the solar vendor can maximise the installation of solar panels with the available roof space for each block, as well as meet our required minimum efficiency. Currently, the industry is mostly using the 72-cell solar panel, each with a capacity of at least 500 Wp, and around 20% efficiency.
You asked how much solar energy does each solar panel generate on an average sunny day. We generally assume around a solar panel gets around 3.3 hours of sun a day. With a capacity of 500 Wp, you can generate around 1.65 kWh a day (i.e. 500 Wp x 3.3 hours).
You asked if there are any specific guidelines that HDB follows when adding features to the solar panels (such as one is not allowed to add anything at all; things that are added must fit within a certain size requirement etc). In general, the solar vendor has to provide solar panels that meet the specifications and standards that are spelt out in our technical specifications. Our solar vendors are free to propose additional features for our consideration (e.g. anti-glare coating), so long the solar panels meet the specifications and standards, and they are generally beneficial to the setup. It is also in the solar vendors’ interests to introduce additional features, only if it’s beneficial, as they want to generate as much solar energy as possible.
If you have more questions, you can reach out to me directly at XXXXX.
Thank you.

Hi Community Partnerships Team, 
My name is XXXXXXXXXXXX and I am currently working on research proposal in the hopes of recieving a Fulbright grant to study the relationship between sustainable housing and community building in Singapore. I am particularly interested in Punggol as a sustainably designed neighborhood, and was wondering if there was anyone I could talk to in order to get some more information about living there and the planned community activities that are available. 
Let me know if there is anywhere I can direct my specific questions or if there is anyone available for a short meeting. I'd love to learn more about life in Punggol and discuss my project in greater depth. 
Sincerely, 
XXXXXXXXXXXX

Good Afternoon XXXXXXXXXXXX,
Thank you for your prompt response,
Regarding Item 1;
We very much appreciate the level of detail in your response. As the case may be, please state   include any major common services affected in the notices as well. (eg. Lifts, Pumps, MDF etc). 
Regarding Item 2;
You have stated 'The notice we have put up is the same at that used for the other shutdowns under Solar Nova Project.' 
Be advised that we acknowledge that while the format of your notice is standard to the ""other"" shutdowns under Solar Nova, 
What we are trying to confirm is if you have carried out your responsibility to INFORM the respective Property Manager/Officer under Town Council and have received proof of Acknowledgement/No Objection from them. This is standard practice not only under the Solar Nova Project but for installations under the purview of TC.  I noticed that you have CCKTC and PM XXXXXXXXXXXX included in the email loop, but I need to confirm if you have received their acknowledgement for your shutdown request. 
If it was not included in the email trail I would appreciate if you would be able to provide it to us.
As per recent developments in July, HDB has informed us that all shutdowns related to Solar Nova Projects in [CCKTC] have to strictly adhere to the following notice distribution procedure/s;
Notices are to be distributed at least 7 days prior to scheduled shutdown to the following areas:-
All Lift Lobbies at every level.
All Stair landings at level 1/lowest level 
ALL RESIDENTIAL/COMMERCIAL UNITS DOOR TO DOOR
​Please make arrangements to comply with the above procedure.
XXXXXXXXXXXX will confirm this. 
To Summarize,
Kindly ask your end to revise the details of the notice.
Kindly furnish us with the letter of Acknowledgement/No Objection from TC
Kindly adhere to the procedure mandated by HDB regarding distribution notice.
Appreciate your understanding on this matter.

Dear XXXXXXXXX,
Thank you for your feedback.
First and foremost, we would like to apologize for the delay in responding.
In regards to your enquiry, we have approached the Solar Panel company and they have informed us that after having surveyed the site, they have found that there were some issues encountered before the installation of the solar panels for the block and therefore skipped this block. 
However, we were recently informed that they were able to resolve the issue and HDB has recently requested the company to begin installation soon.
For a better understanding, you may proceed to enquire with HDB for more details as the Solar Panel installation is not under Town Council purview.
Thank you for your patience and understanding.

6114ce407ea6e9001276f7e206-08-21 22:19NTU-A city in nature - creating a green   liveable home with more trees   parksMy big idea is to save the trees we already have, which are much more well established and diverse. And my idea is to halt deforestation immediately (e.g. Dover Forest).  Mature trees store a disproportionately LARGER amount of carbon and facilitate BETTER WATER RECYLING compared to the young, new trees being planted along the roadside. Why not have one million trees in addition to the ones we already have?  Please save the forests.

However, not all green spaces are the same in terms of ecological significance and legal protection. Thus, my question is: ""Does Singapore have plans to increase either the legal protection of green spaces that are not Nature Reserves or increase the area protected as Nature Reserves?"" This would contribute to both climate mitigation (in terms of carbon sequestration and storage) as well as climate adaptation (mangroves and other intertidal habitats as natural methods to combat sea level rise)

The idea comes because my room’s walls get so hot that you can use it for a hot stone massage and we should think of ways to harness that wasted energy
60f506ae9ce4100012a71a5719-07-21 12:59normal singapore citizen-Green buildingsHi, do you all explore how to use natural sunlight that can be diverted into every room of HDB (incl rooms on opposite side of the house) so that we can reduce turning on the lights in the day time. 
Also whether its possible to build some water tank or pipe that can be near by the aircon ledge to be warmed up gently by the aircon compressor.
Finally, if centralized cooling is more efficient, r u all able to offer it to hdb and condo, but with adjustable settings in each house and filtering system that dont pass virus to each other.
60efbc6f8c8a4a0011ef03a915-07-21 12:41XXXXXXXXReducing waste and recyclingThis idea is in line with food waste recycling (ultimately composting), and the plan to plant a million trees. The video that I am basing my idea of composting on is by NParks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK7Dw8pWH4o ab_channel=NParksSG
Another side idea:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ae4MfwcsX4E ab_channel=SelfSufficientMe
I think that making sustainability a habit is important. One of the ways we can start cultivating a habit of composting through 3 groups of people: Students, community, and cleaners.
As it is now, cleaners are still the ones sweeping up dead/dried leaves, which to my understanding, are still burnt at the end of the day. Instead of burning them up, comes the next group of people
The community, in the form of (majority) volunteers. If institutions can have environmental clubs, I don't see why most CCs and RCs do not have them.
1) They can be the ones to hold the dried leaves collected by the cleaners and transport them to the third group of people (students) on their CCA days. 
2) The community can be responsible for making big buckets with holes for the composting to be done. 
3) They (if the environmental clubs in CCs and RCs are big enough) can venture out and collect vegetable wastes and egg shells from coffee shops or hawkers.
4) If CC has the budget, sponsor some good soil.
The third group, students. If we have environmental clubs in institutions, we should have them in our primary and secondary schools too. I think there already are a few, but I am unsure how many schools really have them. 
1) A new responsibility they can have is to cut the dead leaves, and 'browns' of composting such as paper, cardboard into smaller pieces, as per the video, to hasten the composting process. 
2) Collecting scraps of vegetable wastes or egg shells from their canteen. 
3) Composting.
Therefore, the community and the students have a part to play collectively. The community/teacher (preferrably with someone like the one in the video) can guide the students through in the composting process. 
In the long run, students who graduated can choose to or not to join the environmental clubs in the CC/RC.

60e91bef0ea9aa00113788e210-07-21 12:02--Green buildingsMore help can be given to residents in HDBs to grow their own plants. Not all homes have balconies or extra spaces near their units to grow plants. 
Perhaps the top stories of multi story buildings can be converted into mini garden spaces and plots rented or maintained by individual or collective housing units. This space receives strong sunlight and rainwater directly. Car owners usually avoid parking at the top anyway because of lack of shelter and having to ascend up to the top story. Hence the space is under utilised most of the week (sometimes except for weekends). 
Community gardens already exist but are very small in scale and may not be fair to everyone. Renting out such spaces on the other hand would prevent issues of stealing of plant produce, if residents who want to do such urban gardening fear their produce would get stolen, or people taking more than they should. HDB or NEA could get some revenue from this too. 
Participating in urban gardening increases the number of plants that are natural carbon sequestration mediums; reduces expenses for buying groceries including travelling costs; fosters a sense of appreciation for the origins of food; improves psychological mood and state of mind; and fosters a sharing ‘kampung’ spirit too.
60eaee6d688ed80013ca7bcc11-07-21 21:13--A city in nature - creating a green   liveable home with more trees   parksCreate more community gardens, and also community compost piles where residents can contribute their food waste.
6108d95a9ea71d001218b76617-08-21 15:XXXXXXXXGreen buildings1) All HDBs and private apartments to mandatorily have solar water heaters that are fixed on their roof tops. The roof tops of all housing buildings are largely left vacant and wasted. With solar panels heating the water coming through pipes in each homes, each building can be a little greener. If panels are arranged in rows with gaps, there will room for the below idea too. 
2) the same roof tops could become urban roof gardens. The area under the solar panels can be easily converted to vegetables gardens. With heat   moisture combination available, basic vegetables like gourds, leafy plants can grow easily in the area directly under these panels. These roof gardens could directly be managed by the buildings residents who can be given some wages and discounts. Thus also creating shared value, recreation and togetherness.
610888f98df9c2001480873330-08-21 15:40--Improving energy efficiencyIncrease 1 degree of aircon setting across Singapore! In most of the public places, the current aircon temperature is way too low. By increasing 1 degree, the amount of energy can be saved would be tremendous.
6108b88b1ddc90001214f8a225-08-21 19:24--Green buildingsSingapore could set new laws with new construction standards such that higher minimum levels of thermal insulation need to be achieved for buildings including housing (including for windows with double or triple glass layers in particular). This would reduce the penetration of heat from outside when windows are closed and consequently reduce the use of air conditioning which is highly energy intensive and CO2eq intensive (both from the electricity and the extremely high CO2eq potency of “cooling gases” used in air conditioning).

Cement and steel needs carbon in making .
The sand and aggregates is excavated from our environment. 
With proper design and usage of concrete, there is less direct damages to the environmental

The indirect impact which bring about the lesser use will be the transportation of these materials to site .

With proper design and use of mechanized method like laser screed and armor joints for floors slabs, labors is reduced.
With this reduction comes less social problem and garbage disposal etc.

XXXXXXXXX A city in nature - creating a green   liveable home with more trees   parksHi! I am XXXXXXXXX recent graduate from NUS Architecture. I thought it'd be great to share an idea that I pursued in my final Architecture Master Thesis – for the farms and green spaces in Singapore. 
“The more Garang Farmers will have to look for new ways of farming (…)” was what one of the farmers told me through an interview in response to Lim Chu Kang masterplan, land scarcity, marginalized non-food farms, and Singapore’s efforts to reclaim its heritage Orchid trade as one of the top producers in the US$400million global industry. 
The thesis probes us to rethink a multi-agency/stakeholder approach in assessing the future of marginalized orchid farms in our existing and expanding green spaces, proposing a cooperative to optimize the value chain of orchid cultivation beyond cut flowers for high-value extracts from its large surplus, enlivening of public, community, green and inclusive active spaces. Imagine a bus terminal with an Orchid farm and bus carbon capture system, a hospital with botanical R D and a healing park connector for patients, or a disused HDB altered into a vertical community farm with dye extractions.
How can we continue farming in a land scarce country through a shared value chain; not just for economic benefits but also to enliven the community and public spaces around us. I hope to bring forward the potentials of these developments for a greener and inclusive Singapore!

08-05-21 14:29XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX city in nature - creating a green   liveable home with more trees   parksI would like to see the park in an artistic way that will motivate visitors creativity especially in the field of art and innovation. My idea of an interesting park connect visitors and  animals . At the park visitors will see how broken branches and tree stump can be recycled into art of work. For example, stump into table and chairs, broken woods into bird’s house, animals hide out, etc. To make the garden more appealing tree trunk can be sculpture into figures etc.
The plants in the park can also be shaped into animals , chairs etc. In the park new discoveries of birds can be sighted easily with man made bird houses on the trees to amuse visitors. Visitors will also be treated with art work on the ground with school of artificial colourful fish “swimming “ in a field of grasses. There will be artificial flamingoes in the pond. In addition to all these some live animals will be introduced such as frogs, turtles, fish, cockerel, ducks, etc
Visitors will 
1) engage with nature - to understand the importance of plants ,trees and their uses . 
2) identify  - being able to discover types of plants and species 
3. understanding - uses of the plants for example herbs, vegetables etc and recycling.

Likewise, in every block of HDB flat, there is a water tank that serve the residents . Singapore has an average temperature of between 33-34 degrees. If every block has a blower wind pipe passing through the water tank. Creating heat exchange to the water; the air that blows out is cool air. The fan will be run by solar energy. The residents will enjoy warmer water thus there is a saving of electricity in using heater for bathing . It will reduce the temperature in Singapore.

04-05-21 11:35XXXXXXXX A city in nature - creating a green   liveable home with more trees   parksThe upcoming plan to build a residential / commercial development at Upper Changi Road / Tanah Merah Kechil Link (near Tanah Merah MRT) should be stopped. It is one of the few remaining green open areas available in the vicinity. The new building will not only add to the already congested area, it will remove the greenery, exacerbate pollution with the increase in traffic. It will also reduce the wind flow. Surely there is no need for another such development in an already congested area. I hope that that you can look into this as I'm fairly confident that no ""impact on the environment studies"" were done. Thank you.

28-04-21 10:13XXXXXXXX Green buildingsDaily my home indoor temperature from 11am to late afternoon on the average is 30 degrees without switching on the fan or air con. This is not Sustainable Living in the house at all.
My idea suggestion is if every household can have a ceiling fan or air-con power by solar panel(maybe 2 panels install outside the house facing the afternoon sun direction) to power it. The objective is to reduce indoor temperature to 26-27 degrees which is much more livable.  This solar power fan or air-con will only kick in on a sunny day to reduce the indoor household heat.
This will be my last suggestion as my past few suggestions, I did not receive any acknowledgment of received at all. Most likely they were stuck with tons of other email or suggestions.

Cooling the landscape occupied by our airbases with more trees do made life in the airbase better(maybe reduce outdoor temperature by up to 1 degree), and help adsorb CO2 and other pollution generate by human and aircraft activities.

Subject: [for MND's consideration pls] Compilation of Ideas and Proposals for the SG Green Plan
Message Classification:  Restricted
Dear MND colleagues,
The Green Plan website (www.greenplan.gov.sg) was launched on 10 Feb 2021. As one of the key engagement platforms of the Green Plan (spearheaded by MOE, MND, MSE, MTI, and MOT), the website provides an avenue for members of the public to submit their ideas and proposals which contribute to the Green Plan. 
We have compiled a list of ideas we received so far, and would like to seek your assistance to direct the ideas and proposals received to the relevant teams in your Ministry to acknowledge and follow-up, if required. We also appreciate it if you could copy us at  mse_feedback_mse.gov.sg in your acknowledgement and/or replies for our records. 
The ideas are briefly extracted below for your quick reference. The full details including the submitters’ contact details can be found in the spreadsheet. Feel free to let us know if you require clarifications. Thank you. 
What is your idea about?Tell us your big idea!Remarks
Green buildings173,000 terawatts (trillions of watts) of solar energy strikes the Earth continuously. That's more than 10,000 times the world's total energy use! 
You can only imagine the energy going into just air-conditioning in Singapore. 
I suggest to utilize only the highest performing solar reflective coating to fight the most powerful energy source.

A city in nature - creating a green   liveable home with more trees   parksWe need to turn more outdoor parking lots in the HDB flats into indoor parking lots. The buiding can be rise up at least 5 levels high while the outdoor parking lots can be used to plant more trees. The ground floor of the building can be used as indoor recreational centre such as playing table tennis etc. 
Strengthening our food securityI live in a HDB in Ang Mo Kio. There are spaces around my block that can be converted to edible gardens. We have ample senior citizens who can be trained as gardeners and they can reap the fruits of their labour. This will reduce reliance on food and also generate healthy social activities for the seniors. 
Greener education - encouraging eco-stewardship for schoolsI have founded Earth School Singapore that aims to increase green literacy among Singaporeans, especially youths, through a series of engaging environmental lessons, guides and opportunities. 
Green buildingsMaximise potential of tropical passive building design. Ensure minimum level of effective cross ventilation for all residential apartments, proven by CFD simulation; i.e. no more double loaded floor plans, to minimise use of air conditioning. 
A city in nature - creating a green   liveable home with more trees   parksThis is a very urgent request, at the rate of existing green space being cleared for development. A very obvious example is the Kranji Woodland Scrubland that has been cleared lately. Is conserving secondary forest ever being considered in the Green Plan? Before we talk about planting 1mil new trees across the island, should we re-look into which secondary rustic forest, with significant ecological value to conserve first? I'm no ecologist, however it is simple to understand the plant trees is not simple 1+1 summation; it is a complicated multiplication! Trees takes time to form diversed and sophisticated biodiversity, the value is so much bigger then planting individual trees at random locations purely for aesthetical and carbon sequestration purpose. So my big idea is to re-look at existing secondary forest, halt any plan to clear these places that took decades to form. Please take action promptly. No waiting for another 2 to 3 years. Development pace is very fast. One last note: social media exposure on the falling of these rustic forest is almost instant and widespread, highlighting the contradiction of government's action and the Green Plan. Event like this is creating confusion, overshadowing government's great initiatives on greening future development. 
I hope to see that the issue of clearing existing forest can be addressed soon. This is emergency. 
Green buildingsWe should green the life cycle of our built environment such as Green Architecture, Green Engineering, Green Construction, Green Facilities Management and Green Demolition   management of building waste. We should adopt a holistic approach to educate our Built environment professionals (architects, engineers, project managers, facilities managers, landscape designers and interior designers to go green starting from IHLs to Continuing Professional development programs. We should develop a comprehensive Singapore Standard (SS) for Built Environment which can be adopted globally.

This cAn be a catalyst to instill love of nature and greens amongst the young while creating a healthy lifestyle activity for the aging.

Hi
I'm a Master student currently doing a project on the use of rooftop areas on various buildings in Singapore to install solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. The types of buildings my team members and I are looking at include: HDB, multi-storey carparks and industrial/commercial buildings.
We would like to obtain the following information for the purpose of our study, please let us know if it is possible and where we can obtain them. 
The rooftop area of hdb flats and multi-storey carparks. It can be a range of values as well.
Information on HDB areas that where solar PV systems have been installed, including the size of the area used to install and the amount of solar energy that can be generated.
Thank you and look forward to a positive reply from you soon.

We install solar panels on all types of HDB blocks, as long as it is feasible. The main factor affecting feasibility is whether there is any shading that will affect yield from the solar panels. Rooftop space is usually not the limiting factor, unless there is really no space on the rooftop. Therefore, we are unable to provide a typical rooftop area for installing solar panels.

Feedback DetailIs there a way to make use of all our high rise buildings to harness hydroelectric power? For example, a small reservoir on top of every hdb block? Singapore gets so much rainfall. If we could just let the rainwater collect on the roofs of these high rise buildings before flowing from multiple buildings into one single channel, there should be enough kinetic energy to turn one turbine. And yes rainfall would be intermittent but so is solar. So hydro can employ the same solutions as solar for energy storage.

Since Singapore is lack of horizontal space for solar farm, we should take advantage of our vast vertical facade space for vertical solar farming. This is going to be uniquely Singapore and this is how Singapore can innovate to differentiate ourselves among the big land mass countries.

Please be more sensitive that not everyone has been assigned to work from office for now. I am still working from home and the noises are really causing problems to my meetings.
Perhaps you should inform the residents on the specific dates and time that renovation works will be going on. It is really irritating to stay at home with such noises.

Subject: Concerns and Suggestions over rising costs and Gst Hike, Sustainity and recycling issues and rise in Conservancy charges
Dear XXXXXXXX,
GST Hike
I’m a resident of XXXXXXXX as well as a SME owner operating within Clementi. I am writing in to express my concerns regarding the Budget debate as well as the upcoming increase in GST to an eventual 9% in 2023. 
I am aware the rational behind the increase is to increase revenue for our government in lieu of projected increases in operating expenditure, but I have concerns over:
1. The process in which such conclusions were reached
2. The lack of consultations with the public
3. The timing of the implementation, at a period where the pandemic is still the income of Singaporeans, job security, and global manpower and logistical issues 
4. Coverage of the Goods and Services tax, including imported online and digital goods and lastly,
5. No measures were mentioned or at least communicated to the public regarding cost cutting and sustainability measures to decrease expenditure spending.
Sustainability and Cost Cutting
My training is in psychology but I have only worked in social service and technical sectors, so pardon me if my ideas sound immature, but I wonder if the government has deliberated on cost cutting measures (which have been piloted but not widespread) such as building more sustainable buildings (like Westgate) and cutting down the entire electrical usage of the country. Some lifts, escalators, underground carpark lights have switched to motion sensor-ed, and all traffic lights in Singapore are fitted with LED lights. Why have lights in HDB, even after upgrading were not fitted with energy saving LED lights? My block is still fitted with florescent lights which on the entire night, even though the corridor is more than well lit, even with lesser lights installed.
The entire neighbourhood level one corridors are also fitted with florescent lights and lamps, also next to each other. Perhaps research can be done on the luminance if the lamps and their area of coverage, for the area to be safe enough for walking. The entire Singapore is extremely lit, even in the wee hours of the night.
With the implementation of solar panels (albeit rolling out too slowly), I am sure electricity consumption can go down. 
Conservancy charges
Recently, there is also a price increase in the conservancy costs. The costs were based on the room of your flat (4-room pays more than 3, even though there might be more occupants in the flat. I find this to be unfair.Also, no reasons were explained to us as to why there is a price increase. 
Electronic waste recycling
An issue that I have written in more than once is in the area of electronic waste recycling. I am aware that our Town Council operates a cash for trash service but as of now, there’s no location in Clementi. Also it is extremely impractical as it is hard for residents to keep bulky refuse (such as a spoilt large 60in TV) in the house, just to wait for particular date, time and venue to bring sown spoilt items. As a SME of a repair centre, I have constant amounts of electronic waste that I need to dispose. I have emailed almost every single e-waste company, but they have either not replied, or were only keen in collecting waste in metric ton volumes.
 I was heartened to see Ms Grace Fu grace the opening of TES-B plant at in MAR 2021, and new legislation requiring manufacturers of electronics to also be responsible for taking back their damaged electronics. However, even though TES demonstrated their ability to recycle items as large as washing machines and refrigerators, TES has not replied any of my emails that were sent to them. Apple has outsourced their recycling to a third-party, and they have refused to collect back any of Apple’s items for recycling if they are not in the original assembled state or missing parts. I have found through a private contact who does recycling of gold, and it does not make sense for Apple to use that loophole to reject disassembled parts for recycling.
It does not seem that the recycling scene in Singapore has a marked change in our recycling efforts. Also, the communication of how items are to be recycled is incredibly mixed. For example, there was a video by a team of NUS students saying beverage cans made of aluminium have to be individually rinsed before placing them in the recycling bin, or else it would be contaminated and would be discarded. However, no such posters were put up anywhere, and low-income elderly have been stomping on cans tp flatten them in order to compact them for selling to recyclers. 
I wish such issues could be raised in parliament, at least even a snippet. I do not believe forwarding such feedback to the relevant statutory boards without concrete plans to follow-up would effect any change. At the least, I would like a response on your yhtoughts regarding the points I have raised.
I would think hearing the thoughts from politicians who have experience could also elicit constructive discussions, or correct misconceptions that I have or help me understand the inner workings of the government, or at least provide an avenue where I may be of help.
Regards,
XXXXXXXX

Dear person incharge, 
In view of the eco friendly and green projects promoted by government effort, I have an idea of as follow:
Given that Singapore is a wet (rainy) country:
Use rain water collected on HDB and other buidlings roof top to generate electricity thru down flow force of rain water thru pipes to spin electric turbines and store electrical energy to supply electrical energy to the residential clusters and estate.
Not sure has this idea been implemented.
Just my 2 cents worth.

Subject: Persistent Water Damage To My Unit From The Roof
Dear XXXXXXXX
I'm writing directly to you with regards to a persistent water seepage from my roof that the town council has failed to rectify after three separate appeals over three years.
I live on the top floor of block XXXXXXXX and during your last house visit when we met to congratulate you on your election win in 2020, I brought up the matter.
I was assured that it would be looked into but these past week has proved otherwise.
I've been living here three years and from the first month of moving in, there has been water seepage and it is causing damage that I am sure neither HDB nor the town council will be liable for since it is in my flat.
I had spoken to the town council representative for the last two years and though I had been assured the problem would be addressed, it has not. I was told it is a common problem during rainy seasons and that many flats face the same issues.  It was quite a nonchalant respond to something that poses a real hazard, especially when we pay monthly conservancy fees.  I now have to incur personal expenses to rectify the damage caused by improper maintenance of the roof.
I was told repair works had been carried out in 2020 which means either the contractor has not done a competent job or the remediation options given to the contractor have been limited by the town council. 
The flat is less than a third into its lease tenure so problems like these are hard to comprehend nor is the lack of successful remedial works. Spalling concrete has been at the forefront of several flats recently and when it does happen to my flat due to rain water seepage, I, not the town council will be made liable for it. The affected areas are spreading over two bedrooms now and it is becoming dangerous.
There had been clear, visible damage barely a month after I had moved in after a full renovation and before the problem becomes structural and hazardous, if it is not already, I need you to look into this seriously. 
I can be contacted via email or at XXXXXXXX.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
XXXXXXXX

Hi, 
Can you provide an update on whether any rectification works have been done in relation to my last email as 
the roof is still leaking. No one has followed up on this while it’s being pushed around between  HDB, the solar panel contractor and the town council. This is a problem going back almost 4 years and it has not been fully fixed. My unit and ceiling are badly damaged as a result and nothing conclusive is being done to see to this. 
I’m sure my monthly conservancy fees over the last 4years should allow this to be seen to so why has nothing be resolved since?
Please contact me at XXXXXXXX for a conclusive update on when this will be resolved.
Regards,
XXXXXXXX

Hi, 
There’s a very bad leak from my ceiling again with the water dripping into the floor. This is a persistent problem that got worse after the solar panels were installed. Please send someone to rectify this immediately as it’s causing a lot of damage to my unit, furniture and wooden floor. 
Please contact my wife at XXXXXXXX as I’m overseas this week.

Dear Mr XXXXXXXX,
I'm writing directly to you with regards to a persistent water seepage from my roof that the town council has failed to rectify after three separate appeals over three years.
I live on the top floor of XXXXXXXX and during your last house visit when we met to congratulate you on your election win in 2020, I brought up the matter.
I was assured that it would be looked into but these past week has proved otherwise.
I've been living here three years and from the first month of moving in, there has been water seepage and it is causing damage that I am sure neither HDB nor the town council will be liable for since it is in my flat.
I had spoken to the town council representative for the last two years and though I had been assured the problem would be addressed, it has not. I was told it is a common problem during rainy seasons and that many flats face the same issues.  It was quite a nonchalant respond to something that poses a real hazard, especially when we pay monthly conservancy fees.  I now have to incur personal expenses to rectify the damage caused by improper maintenance of the roof.
I was told repair works had been carried out in 2020 which means either the contractor has not done a competent job or the remediation options given to the contractor have been limited by the town council. 
The flat is less than a third into its lease tenure so problems like these are hard to comprehend nor is the lack of successful remedial works. Spalling concrete has been at the forefront of several flats recently and when it does happen to my flat due to rain water seepage, I, not the town council will be made liable for it. The affected areas are spreading over two bedrooms now and it is becoming dangerous.
There had been clear, visible damage barely a month after I had moved in after a full renovation and before the problem becomes structural and hazardous, if it is not already, I need you to look into this seriously. 
I can be contacted via email or at XXXXXXXX.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
XXXXXXXX

We had assisted the Town Council to get the waterproofing contractor, Sunseap, to conduct waterproofing repairs on the roof on 26 May 2022.
We understand that the leakage issue has been persisting since about 4 years ago based on the resident’s feedback, before the solar panel installation had taken place. As such, we appreciate if the TC could monitor and follow up on this case as necessary. Thank you.

"Hi, 
I was told the works on the rooftop were completed. Why has the drilling and hacking noises started again? 
The construction starts on random days in a week, early in the morning, seriously disrupting my sleep. I understand if there are works to be completed, but can it be expedited?
It just keeps dragging out for too long with works done on random days through an extended period of time instead of just working on it everyday and have it completed ASAP. 
Hope to hear from you soon, I have been getting insomnia due to this odd construction patterns.

","           Please refer to your feedback on construction noise on the rooftop of XXXXX
2,        There are still minor electrical works left and this should be completed by end of the month. We have instructed the contractor to keep the noise to a minimum. However, as with any construction related works, some noise can be expected and we seek your understanding on this.

Email:XXXXXXXX","Launched in 2014, the SolarNova programme is a Whole-Of-Government effort led by the Economic Development Board (EDB) and HDB to accelerate the deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in Singapore. This programme aggregates public sector demand across HDB estates and government buildings, to achieve economies of scale, as well as drive the growth of Singapore’s solar industry.
Having achieved our earlier solar target of 220 MWp for HDB towns, HDB had, in 2019 announced a new solar target of 540 MWp for HDB towns by 2030. This new target could potentially generate 648 GWh of green energy annually, contributing towards the national solar targets of 1.5 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2025, and 2 GWp by 2030 as set out under the Singapore Green Plan. It is also in line with the HDB Green Towns Programme to harness green energy and bring sustainable living to all HDB towns. 
HDB strives to install solar panels on as many HDB blocks as possible, subject to factors such as the availability of roof space, and whether the roofs are free from any shading effects. To date, HDB has called or awarded tenders for a total solar capacity of about 380 MWp, and installation is ongoing.

Feedback DetailSingapore is well endowed with a lot of sunlight, but it is not making good use of it, esp for those living in flats to tap on solar energy to offset the rising electricity. Solar energy is only benefitting the rich who can build into their houses and sell back excess to govt. Can govt look into this to help the citizens by making solar energy panels more affordable and efficient for flats?

","Thank you for your feedback and interest in solar PV.
Launched in 2014, the SolarNova programme is a Whole-Of-Government effort led by the Economic Development Board (EDB) and HDB to accelerate the deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in Singapore. This programme aggregates public sector demand across HDB estates and government buildings, to achieve economies of scale, as well as drive the growth of Singapore’s solar industry. Under the programme, HDB strives to install solar panels on as many HDB blocks as possible, subject to factors such as the availability of roof space, and whether the roofs are free from any shading effects. The solar PV systems on the block helps to generate clean solar energy to power the common areas, including the lifts, lights, and water pumps.
Having achieved our earlier solar target of 220 MWp for HDB towns, HDB had, in 2019 announced a new solar target of 540 MWp for HDB towns by 2030. This new target could potentially generate 648 GWh of green energy annually, contributing towards the national solar targets of 1.5 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2025, and 2 GWp by 2030 as set out under the Singapore Green Plan. It is also in line with the HDB Green Towns Programme to harness green energy and bring sustainable living to all HDB towns.

Referring to the interim reply given on 9/6/22.
We have discussed with Sembcorp, and they will be tilting and adjusting the solar panels to address the glare concern that you have raised.
Tentatively, Sembcorp will be performing the adjustment works within the next 2-3months, as materials and manpower need to be arranged.
Once the works are completed, we will inform and check-in with you.

Dear All,
A chronological timeline of events so that we are all on the same page:
Main issue
Resident stays at the top level of Block 283 and after installation of Solar Panels, the water proofing of the unit had allegedly been compromised and turned mouldy.  When the contractors (SembCorp) sent workers to rectify after several complaints, it seemed that they did not do a proper job resulting in patches in the ceiling and staining the furniture at the bottom.  
19 December 2021
First email to Adviser indicating that he had shared about the issue previously when they had met in Tembusu Park.
21 December 2021
Adviser’s first reply indicating for TC to assess and provide views on rectification.
28 January 2022
Resident indicated no reply or inspection arranged by TC
15 March 2022
Resident indicated that a joint inspection had been held by HDB, TC, and SembCorp.  Resident felt that the inspection had been unsatisfactory as nothing was finalised.  Resident was also unhappy about the following:
TC officer indicating that “interior of the HDB flat should be maintained and responsibility should be taken up by the HDB flat owner” as the defects were caused by the solar panel installation.
Apparently the previous TC officer who was attached to the case had left and the newly attached officer had no prior information
TC officer indicating that the ceiling was in “acceptable condition” but the resident disagreed due to the many colour shades
Resident opined that either TC or HDB should front the rectification as SembCorp had commented that rectification will depend on whether they had budget and resident felt this should not be their concerns as “Whether the solar panel company has the budget to repair, it should not concern us”.
26 March 2022
Resident felt that the agencies were shifting the responsibility towards one another as she received an email from HDB indicating that they need more time with the feedback
8 April 2022
TC replied to resident that the case surfaced in Feb 2019 whereby TC assessed the ceiling defects were not related to the re-roofing works but provided a goodwill paint job.  Thereafter in November 2020, a roof leak was reported but was assessed by TC and SembCorp that  it was not a roof leak issue but SembCorp had again provided a goodwill paint job.
10 April 2022
Resident brought up the issue when Adviser did house visit to Block 283.  TC took photos of the alleged damage to furniture.
12 April 2022
Resident acknowledged in email that TC had taken photos of the alleged damage to furniture after SembCorp’s paint job during the house visit.  Resident also clarified that the first incident reported in Feb 2019 was derived from water tank waterproofing “being inefficient after 30 years” and that the  current “solar panel” caused issue was a separate matter.
4 June 2022
Resident emailed and highlighted that no follow-up was done after the house visit.
Thank you.
Best regards,

This issue has arisen again as the resident has stated that there’s been no follow up. 
I understand that TC team has done it utmost to assist the resident. Can I ask HDB and/or the solar panel contractor on the steps that have been taken and the assistance that can be provided to the resident on the repainting and his alleged claims? 
I’ve asked XXXXXXXX, our Constituency Director to collate the necessary facts and details and I would appreciate an update on this matter please.

Dear Adviser,
Thanks for the email.  CCKTC, HDB and Sembcorp just had a virtual meeting to discuss this matter.
This unit is located at the top floor and resident claimed that back in year 2018 there was a leak and Town Council (TC) had assisted to carry out the repairs.  We have requested TC to make a check on the case history on what happened then.  For Adviser’s info, the most recent joint inspection by TC, HDB and Sembcorp established that there is no leak.  On the claim by resident on the stained furniture when Sembcorp kindly assisted to carry out some goodwill painting in Feb last year, Sembcorp will provide some requirements for their assessment of the case by today (but visually the staff who attended the joint inspection 2 months ago did not see any visible stains).  We will continue to work together on the case.  For your info pls.
Regards,
XXXXXXXX
Cc AXXXXXXXX – thanks for the discussion and pls do provide further update to Adviser as appropriate and assist to engage the resident.  Appreciate working together on this case.

Dear Holland-Bukit Panjang HDB Town Council,
I am currently staying at Level 17 of Blk 440, Fajar Road. There has been some contract / renovation / drilling work on the roof, since yesterday, 13 June. 
There were some heavy drilling and they were intermittently taking place since 9 am to 5 pm. There was no notification / notice of such works at the void deck / in the lift. Unfortunately, during this period of time, my 2-year-old daughter is down with very high fever and she was not able to get her rest (as I was not able to pre-empt the drilling works) and my husband could not make arrangement to work in the office as his work involves making a lot of calls to students and parents. 
---
I would like to find out:
1. Why was there no notice informing the residents of the block of such works going on?
2. When is the work expected to end so that I can make alternative arrangements for my girl to get better soon?

Looking forward to a favourable reply from you the soonest. Thank you.

Dear Mr. Liang,
My name is XXXXXXXX, and my wife is XXXXXXXX- we are the owner of the captioned HDB unit, but have the unit leased to a family with a young child.
We are writing to seek your assistance to this very unhappy episode which has lasted for 6 months since it occured. I am providing a cronolog of events, but if you need any evidence of these activities, I will be pleased to furnish.
January 2022
As you may be aware, solar panels installation was recently carried out to the block some time in January 2022, and according to my tenants lastly for weeks. During this time, the tenants informed us of drilling, hammering, loud loading and unloading at the roof.
Week of 10 January
1. It was the week of 10 January during the period of installation, that our tenants started witnessing tiles bulging, and on 10 January, tiles started falling. These pictures are dated 10 January. The situation as of today is worst off.
2. On the same 10 January 2022, we called for help from the town council, who promptly inspected on the 11 January.
3. Soon after, HDB contacted us, and finally on 26 January, HDB inspected the unit, and with XXXXXXXX following up on this case.
[IMAGE][IMAGE]
February 2022
1. Mr. Ong called in February (unfortunately I do not have the exact date), and claimed our unit is old, and the tiles are “hollowed”, and the installation work carried out is not directly above our unit- and therefore does not affect our unit. We have to therefore shoulder 100% of any cost for the repair of our wall.
2. My wife naturally contested this claim, with the fact that NOTHING HAPPENED prior to this work being carried out- and the entire episode of files bulging and falling off, coincided perfected with the period of work.
3. We refuse to accept this claim, and insist of a full reinstatement of our wall with no cost.
From February until 6 July (almost 5 months of desperation)
1. Through this period, my wife was desperately trying to get Mr. Ong to “REINSTATE” our unit’s wall. We emphasise reinstate because we ONLY want the wall to be in the same state before all these work was done at the roof- nothing more.
2. It was almost a monthly affair of trying to engage Mr. Ong via their HDB chat, repeated call of exasperation, with no result.
3. Finally on 6 July, Mr Ong called for a meeting at our said unit together with the contractor of the solar panel installation, and said the contractor will foot 50% of the bill for the wall to be reinstated.
4. My wife was furious after making the trip to meet, because firstly we were expecting a FULL REINSTATEMENT AT NO COST, but also for the following reasons;
i. HDB in the process acknowledge some “inferior work” could have resulted in the bulging, but because it is more than 15 years, and because we have a corner cabinet installed, it is not warranted by HDB.
Ii. The contractor claim 50% payment BECAUSE it was inferior work of HDB.
And this Mr. Liang, was after 6 months almost begging for a conclusion- a reasonable conclusion of simply making good a wall which was in almost perfect condition until all these work carried out.
And this was from the blessings that when the tiles fell, no child or adult was present and hurt.
It has been 6 months, of being given the cold shoulder by a huge government body, of which it was a pain trying to get someone to help.
Mr. Liang, I do not stay in the unit thankfully, but anyone copied in this mail, PUT YOURSELF in the unit, with tiles falling off, and now being tapped together to prevent further mishaps, and you tell me what is the urgency in this matter.
Looking forward to someone to assist.
