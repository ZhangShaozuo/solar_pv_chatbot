figure 1. the difference between solar thermal and solar pv systems 
1.1 introduction
  the  sun delivers its energy to us in two main forms: heat and light. there are two main 
types of solar power systems, namely, solar thermal systems that trap heat to warm up 
water, and solar pv systems that convert sunlight directly into electricity as shown in 
figure 1.
 
  when  the pv modules are exposed to sunlight, they generate direct current ("dc") 
electricity. an inverter then converts the dc into alternating current ("ac") electricity, 
so that it can feed into one of the building's ac distribution boards ("acdb") without 
affecting the quality of power supply. 5

figure 2. grid-connected solar pv system configuration1.2  types of solar pv system
  solar  pv systems can be classified based on the end-use application of the technology. 
there are two main types of solar pv systems: grid-connected (or grid-tied) and off-grid 
(or stand alone) solar pv systems.
 grid-connected solar pv systems
  the  main application of solar pv in singapore is grid-connected,  as singapore's  main 
island is well covered by the national power grid. most solar pv systems are installed 
on buildings or mounted on the ground if land is not a constraint. for buildings, they are 
either mounted on the roof or integrated into the building. the latter is also known as 
building integrated photovoltaics  ("bipv"). with bipv, the pv module usually displaces 
another building component,  e.g. window glass or roof/wall cladding, thereby serving a 
dual purpose and offsetting some costs.
  the configuration of a grid-connected solar pv system is shown in figure 2.  
  a building has two parallel power supplies, one from the solar pv system and the other 
from the power grid. the combined power supply feeds all the loads connected to the 
main acdb. 
  the  ratio of solar pv supply to power grid supply varies, depending on the size of the 
solar pv system. whenever the solar pv supply exceeds the building's demand, excess 
electricity will be exported into the grid. when there is no sunlight to generate pv 
electricity at night, the power grid will supply all of the building's demand.6

figure 3. off-grid solar pv system configuration
 a grid-connected  system can be an effective way to reduce your dependence  on utility 
power, increase renewable energy production, and improve the environment.
 off-grid solar pv systems
  off-grid  solar pv systems are applicable for areas without power grid. currently, such 
solar pv systems are usually installed at isolated sites where the power grid is far away, 
such as rural areas or off-shore islands. but they may also be installed within the city in 
situations where it is inconvenient  or too costly to tap electricity from the power grid. 
for example, in singapore, several ura parking sign lights are powered by off-grid solar 
pv systems.
  an  off-grid solar pv system needs deep cycle rechargeable  batteries such as lead-acid, 
nickel-cadmium  or lithium-ion batteries to store electricity for use under conditions 
where there is little or no output from the solar pv system, such as during the night, as 
shown in figure 3 below.
1.3  solar pv technology
  this  section gives a brief description of the solar pv technology and the common 
technical terms used. 
  a solar pv system is powered by many crystalline or thin film pv modules.  individual 
pv cells are interconnected to form a pv module. this takes the form of a panel for easy 
installation.

(wafer based)thin film  pv cells are made of light-sensitive  semiconductor  materials that use photons to dislodge 
electrons to drive an electric current. there are two broad categories of technology used 
for pv cells, namely, crystalline silicon, as shown in figure 4 which accounts for the 
majority of pv cell production; and thin film, which is newer and growing in popularity. 
the "family tree" in figure 5 gives an overview of these technologies  available today 
and figure 6 illustrates some of these technologies.

 crystalline silicon and thin film technologies
  crystalline  cells are made from ultra-pure silicon raw material such as those used in 
semiconductor  chips. they use silicon wafers that are typically 150-200 microns (one 
fifth of a millimetre) thick.
  thin  film is made by depositing layers of semiconductor  material barely 0.3 to 2 
micrometres thick onto glass or stainless steel substrates.  as the semiconductor layers 
are so thin, the costs of raw material are much lower than the capital equipment and 
processing costs.

 technology module efficiency
  mono-crystalline silicon   12.5-15%
  poly-crystalline silicon  11-14%
  copper indium gallium selenide (cigs)  10-13%
  cadmium telluride (cdte)  9-12%
  amorphous silicon (a-si)  5-7%
 t able 1. conversion efficiencies of various pv module technologies
  apart  from aesthetic differences,  the most obvious difference amongst pv cell 
technologies is in its conversion efficiency, as summarised in table 1.
  for  example, a thin film amorphous silicon pv array will need close to twice the space 
of a crystalline silicon pv array because its module efficiency is halved, for the same 
nominal capacity under standard test conditions1  (stc) rating.
1standard test conditions refer to the following testing conditions:
* 1,000w/m2 of sunlight
* 250c cell temperature
* spectrum at air mass of 1.5

solar photovolt aic ("pv") systems - an overview
  for crystalline silicon pv modules, the module efficiency is lower compared to the sum 
of the component cell efficiency due to the presence of gaps between the cells and the 
border around the circuit i.e., wasted space that does not generate any power hence 
lower total efficiency.  
 effects of temperature 
  another  important differentiator  in solar pv performance,  especially in hot climates, is 
the temperature  coefficient of power. pv cell performance  declines as cell temperature 
rises. 
  for  example, in bright sunlight, cell temperatures  in singapore can reach over 70oc, 
whereas pv modules are rated at a cell temperature  of 25oc. the loss in power output 
at 70oc is therefore measured as (70 - 25) x temperature coefficient.
  most  thin film technologies  have a lower negative temperature  coefficient compared to 
crystalline technologies.   in other words, they tend to lose less of their rated capacity as 
temperature  rises. hence, under singapore's  climatic condition, thin film technologies 
will generate 5-10% more electricity per year.
  a pv module data sheet should specify the temperature  coefficient. see table 2 and 
chart in figure 7.

1.4  technical information 
  single-core,  double isolated sheathed cables that can withstand the environmental 
conditions, and minimise the risk of earth faults and short circuits are used to interconnect 
the pv strings and arrays. the cable connections  are protected in enclosures known as 
junction box that provides the necessary connectors as shown in figure 10.figure 8. pv string figure 9. pv array
figure 10. junction box
 electricity produced by the solar pv installation is in the form of dc.  the output of the 
pv installation is connected through the dc main cables to the dc terminals of the pv 
inverter where electricity is converted from dc into ac.
  after  conversion,  the ac current of the pv inverter is connected through pv supply 
cable to the building's electrical installation (ac distribution board).  
  figure  11 shows a typical pv inverter connected to the electrical installation of a 
building.  note that the actual configuration  of the pv inverter may vary across different 
systems.    the pv modules are next connected in series into a pv string as shown in figure 8.
  a pv array as shown in figure 9 is formed by the parallel aggregation of pv strings.

   just  like any electrical installation in a building, earthing is an important safety requirement 
for solar pv system. arrangement must be made for proper connection of the solar pv system to the consumer's electrical installation earthing system.
  in locations susceptible  to lightning strikes, a lightning protection system must be 
provided, and all the exposed metallic structures of the solar pv system must be bound 
to the lightning earthing system.
  it is the responsibility  of the consumers to have their solar pv systems maintained 
regularly to ensure safe operation of their solar pv systems and electrical installations. see figure 12 for a diagram showing the solar pv system forming part of a consumer's 
electrical installation.figure 11. t ypical pv inverter connected to a

2solar pv systems 
on a building
2.1  introduction
  there  are many examples overseas where pv modules are mounted on the roof and 
integrated into building facades. they work particularly well in europe and north america, 
as south-facing facades in these regions are well exposed to the sun.  
  in singapore, we have to consider that the sun passes almost directly overhead.  this is 
because we are located near the equator, and the path of the sun follows the equator, 
with seasonal variations of up to 23.5o to the north or south.  therefore there are optimal 
positions to locate the pv modules that have to be taken into consideration.  refer to 
appendix a for examples of solar pv systems on buildings in singapore. 
2.2 installation angle 
  to  maximise electricity production for use in singapore, the best location for the 
pv modules to be installed is right on top of a building, facing the sky. the possible 
installation options are shown in figure 13.

figure 14. pv module frames trap dirt as water evaporates from a
flat-mounted pv module vertical facades and steeply sloped roofs tend to suffer a big loss in the ability to generate 
electricity in exchange for higher public visibility. 
  with  the pv modules facing the sky, it is possible to improve the yield by installing pv 
modules on trackers to follow the sun from east to west during the day (single-axis 
trackers), and from north to south during seasonal changes (dual-axis trackers).
  however,  trackers can only improve system performance  under direct sunshine, and 
they give no advantage in diffused sunlight conditions, such as on cloudy or hazy days. 
  the  down side of having flat-mounted  pv modules is that they tend to get dirty from 
rain water and dust. see figure 14. it is therefore better to mount the pv modules at an 
incline (10-15o for framed modules, or as little as 3-5o for unframed modules), to allow 
rain water to properly drain off
2.3  avoid shading pv modules
 pv modules should be free from shade. shading of any single cell of a crystalline silicon pv module will drastically reduce the output of the entire pv module. 
  thin  film pv modules are more tolerant to partial shading than crystalline silicon pv 
modules. typical culprits include shadows cast by tall trees and neighbouring  buildings.chapter 2solar pv systems on a building
