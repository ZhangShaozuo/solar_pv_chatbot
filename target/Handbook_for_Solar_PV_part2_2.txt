5.1 operations of solar pv systems
 
 the most practical indicator of the performance of the solar pv systems can be obtained from the remote monitoring and data logging software supplied by most inverter 
manufacturers.
  the  data logging software will record daily, monthly, and annual output for comparison of 
the actual system performance  against the expected system performance.  see figure 
20 for typical performance monitoring displays.
   
  solar  pv systems require minimal maintenance,  as they do not usually have moving 
parts. however, routine maintenance  is required to ensure the solar pv system will 
continue to perform properly.
  it is a good practice for contractors  of solar pv systems to provide an operation & 
maintenance  ("o&m") manual for the client. the manual should include basic system 
data, test and commissioning data, o&m data, and warranty information.

5.2 recommended preventive maintenance works 
  it is recommended  that preventive inspection and maintenance  works are carried out 
every six to twelve months. the pv modules require routine visual inspection for signs 
of damage, dirt build-up or shade encroachment.  solar pv system fixtures must be 
checked for corrosion. this is to ensure that the solar pv system is safely secured.
  while  the inverter's functionality  can be remotely verified, only on-site inspection can 
verify the state of lightning surge arrestors, cable connections, and circuit breakers.
  the  following table shows some recommendations  on the preventive maintenance 
works on the components  and equipment, and the corresponding  remedial actions to 
be carried out by qualified personnel.
