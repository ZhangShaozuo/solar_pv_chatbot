chapter 3
appointing a solar pv system contractor
  significantly,  most manufacturers  specify that the pv module output will be determined 
by the flash testers in their own premises, rather than by a third party.
  the  solar pv system contractor should assist in determining  whether a pv module 
defect is covered by warranty, and should handle the situation with the manufacturer.
 regular maintenance
  during  the defect liability periof = open(os.path.join(src_path, path), 'r').read()d (usually for 12 months after installation),  solar pv system 
contractors usually use remote monitoring data to prepare monthly performance reports 
of the installed solar pv system. they should come on site to rectify any problems flagged by the remote monitoring service.
 other relevant matters 
  another  matter to be aware of is that pv module manufacturers  are constantly upgrading 
their products, and adapting new sizes and dimensions  to suit market requirements. 
this means that you may no longer be able to buy an identical pv module to replace a defective one in your pv array a few years after installation. newer pv modules are 
likely to be more efficient or have different physical dimensions,  and may no longer fit 
exactly into the gap left by the old pv module.
  this  does not matter much on a large, ground-mounted  solar pv power plant, because 
the new modules can form a new row. but on a building-mounted  solar pv system it 
may spoil the aesthetics, and may cause problems to the electrical configuration.

installation 
requirements
4.1  electrical installation licence
  an  electrical installation refers to any electrical wiring, fitting or apparatus used for 
the conveyance  and control of electricity in any premises. a solar pv system installed 
within such premises forms part of the consumer's  electrical installation and should 
comply with the requirements  stipulated in the electricity act (cap. 89a), the electricity 
(electrical installations)  regulations  and the singapore standard cp5 code of practice 
for electrical installations.  
  under  the electricity act, the energy market authority ("ema") licenses all non-
residential electrical installations,  with demand exceeding 45 kilo volt ampere or kva. for 
residential electrical installations  and non-residential  electrical installations  with demand 
below the threshold 45kva, no electrical installation licence is required. 
  the  licence requires the owner of the electrical installation to engage an lew to take 
charge of the electrical installation and comply with the relevant safety standards and 
requirements.  your appointed lew shall consult sp powergrid ltd on their technical 
requirements  and procedures,  if you wish to operate your solar pv system in parallel 
with the power grid. the objective is to ensure all electrical installations,  including solar 
pv systems, are safe to use. 
4.2  electrical safety standards and requirements 
  a grid-connected  solar pv system operates in parallel with the power grid supply.  the 
power grid supply is considered the source, and the electrical installation with the solar 
pv system connected is considered as the load. 
  the  technical requirement  for installation of a solar pv system is given in section 612 of 
the singapore standard cp5.  
  there  are international  product standards on pv modules and electrical components.   for 
example, pv modules should comply with the requirements  of iec 61215 for crystalline 
silicon terrestrial pv modules or iec 61646 for thin-film terrestrial pv modules.  in 
addition, pv array junction box, pv generator junction box and switchgear assemblies 
should comply with the requirements of iec 60439-1.

4.3  application of electrical installation licence 
  your  lew will be able to advise you whether you need to apply to ema for an electrical 
installation licence for the use or operation of the electrical installation within the 
premises of your building. 
  if an electrical installation licence is needed, your lew will submit the licence application 
to ema on your behalf. if you already have an electrical installation licence issued by 
ema, you need not apply for a separate licence for the solar pv system within the same 
premises.
  the  electrical licence fee payable to ema is $100 per year (exclusive of goods and 
services tax). 
4.4  conservation and development control requirements
  at present, there is no specific requirement  or control by the urban redevelopment 
authority ("ura") on the use of installations  such as a solar pv system. however, 
conservation  projects, or projects within the central area are subject to ura's urban 
design evaluation process. 
  the  standard development  control guidelines apply to projects that may not be subject 
to conservation  or urban design requirements,  depending on which structure(s)  the 
solar pv system is installed onto. for example, if a solar pv system is installed on the 
rooftop of an attic, then the attic guidelines will apply. likewise, if a solar pv system is 
installed on raised structures like a pavilion, then the pavilion guidelines will apply. 
4.5  guidelines on conservation and development control
  architects  are advised to refer to the conservation  and development  control guidelines 
when designing a development  with a solar pv system installation.  the respective 
guideline is available at ura's website:
    http://www.ura.gov.sg/conservation/cons%20guidelines.pdf    http://www.ura.gov.sg/circulars/text/dchandbook.html
  should  you have further enquiries on whether your installations  conflict with the urban 
design or development  control guidelines, you may submit your enquiries to ura either 
in person or through a qualified person ("qp") -- a qp is either a registered architect 
or an engineer -- with the accompanying  plans of the structures on which the solar pv 
system will be installed: 
    conserved buildings

  should  a formal development  application to ura be required, it must be made via a qp. 
the details can be checked at the two web links below:

    http://www.peb.gov.sg/peb/process/searchpe4.6  structural safety and lightning protection 
 structural safety
  to ensure safety, there are measures and steps that need to be taken or considered 
when installing a solar pv system onto a new or an existing building. for new building 
developments,  the design of the structure must take into consideration  the loading of 
the solar pv system installation, just like any other equipment mounted onto a building 
structure. 
  for  existing buildings, a professional  structural engineer may be required to carry out an 
inspection of the roof structure, and do a calculation on the structural loading. if the roof 
is unable to withstand the loading  of the solar pv system, structural plans will need to 
be submitted to the building and construction  authority ("bca") for approval before a 
building permit can be issued for commencement  of installation works. the application 
guideline is available at the following bca's website:
    http://www.bca.gov.sg/structuralplan/structural_plan_application.html
 lightning protection
  given  a certain location, solar pv systems are exposed to the threat of lightning strikes. 
as lightning can cause damage to the pv modules and inverters, extra care must be 
taken to ensure that proper lightning protection is provided for the solar pv system and 
the entire structure. the inverters should be protected by appropriately  rated surge 
arrestors on the dc side. it is good practice to also install surge arrestors on the ac side. 
structures and pv module frames must be properly grounded.
4.7  connection to the power grid 
  if a solar pv system is designed to meet only a fraction of the electricity load, the 
system will need to be interconnected  with the power grid to meet the remainder of the 
consumer's needs for electricity. 
  if a solar pv system needs to be grid-connected, interconnection is key to the safety of 
both consumers and electrical workers, and to the protection of equipment.

4.8  get connected to the power grid
  if you intend to connect and operate your solar pv system in parallel to the power grid, 
your appointed lew will have to consult sp powergrid ("sppg") on the connection 
scheme and technical requirements.
 
  the  following documents  set out the detailed consultation  process and technical 
requirements:
  *  the transmission code and the metering code are published at ema's website:

  *  sppg's  handbook, how to apply for electricity connection,  is published at sp 
powerasset's website:
      http://www.sppowerassets.com.sg/pdf/howtoapply.pdf
4.9  sale of solar pv electricity
  the  excess electricity generated from a grid-connected  solar pv can be sold back to the 
power grid.  the arrangements  needed to enable this sale of solar pv electricity vary, 
depending on whether you are a contestable or non-contestable consumer.
  consumers  are classified, based on their average monthly electricity consumption, 
into:
  *  contestable  consumers:  these consumers are the non-residential  consumers who 
use more than 10,000 kwh of electricity a month. contestable  consumers have a 
choice of who they wish to buy their electricity from. they may purchase electricity 
from a retailer, directly from the wholesale market (provided they are registered 
with the energy market company as market participants)  or indirectly from the 
wholesale market through sp services.
   *  non-contestable  consumers: these consumers comprise all the residential electricity 
users and non-residential  consumers who use less than 10,000 kwh of electricity a 
month. these consumers are supplied with electricity by sp services.
 contestable consumers
 if you are a contestable consumer generating electricity from a solar pv system and wish to sell and get paid for the electricity you inject into the power grid, you will be 
required to register with the energy market company ("emc") to participate in the 
wholesale electricity market, which is called the national electricity market of singapore 
or nems.

  as a market participant, you will need to comply with the market rules, which is available 
at emc's website:
    http://www.emcsg.com/marketrules  by selling electricity in the wholesale electricity market, you will be paid the prevailing 
electricity spot price for the electricity that you inject into the power grid. the electricity 
spot price varies every half-hour, depending on the demand-supply  situation in the 
wholesale electricity market.
  the  market will also offer services and system resources to you, but you will be subjected 
to market charges in respect to the gross generation output from your registered pv 
system, for the provision of the market services and system resources.

 non-contestable consumers
  if you are a non-contestable  consumer generating electricity of less than 1 mw and 
wish to sell and get paid for the electricity you inject into the power grid, you need not 
apply for a generation or wholesaler (generation  ) licence nor register with the emc 
as a market participant.   you will have to apply to sp services ("sps") by following the 
application procedure set out in appendix b. 
  non-contestable  consumers are compensated  by sps for electricity exported to the 
power grid by way of a credit adjustment to the consumer's  monthly electricity bill, 
based on the prevailing low-tension electricity tariff less the grid charge. 
  the  credit adjustment will effectively compensate  the non-contestable  consumer for 
the amount of electricity exported into the power grid during that month. 
  this  scheme to compensate  non-contestable  consumers with generation capacity of 
less than 1mw for the electricity they export into the power grid is not applicable to 
those consumers  whose electricity consumption  is metered under the master-sub 
metering scheme.  
  master-sub  metering schemes refer to metering arrangements  where there is a 
master-meter  measuring the overall electricity consumed by the building (i.e. both the 
individual units and the common services), with sub-meters measuring the usage of the 
individual units.  such metering schemes are typically used in private condominiums 
and commercial buildings.
  under  a master-sub metering arrangement,  the electricity that an individual unit attempts 
to export into the grid may in fact be used up by the common services or by other 
individual units. as it is not possible to track the actual flow of the electricity exported 
by the individual units, the credit adjustment scheme cannot be applied to those under 
the master-sub metering scheme.
