2. electricity generation licence  
 
the electricity licensing requirements for solar pv systems will be based on the 
aggregate of the alternating current (ac) inverter capacities ("installed generation 
capacity") at the point of connection1 to the grid.   
 
any person who engages in the generation of electricity with a solar pv system with 
installed generation capacity of 1 mw ac or more but less than 10 mw ac is required to 
apply to ema for a wholesaler (generation) licence.  for installed generation capacity 
of 10 mw ac or more , he has to apply for a generation licence.  
 
all relevant licenses should be obtained before any turn -on of solar pv installations.  
 
a summary of the licensing requirements is shown in the table below.

* an electrical installation licence may still be required.  
 
application for the wholesaler or generation licence can be made on ema's 
website: http://www.ema.gov.sg/licensees_electricity_licences.aspx  
3. electrical installation  
 
an electrical installation refers to any electrical wiring, fitting or apparatus used for the 
conveyance and control of electricity in any premises. a solar pv system installed within 
such premises forms part of the consumer's electrical installation and should comply 
with the requirements stipulated in the electricity act (cap. 89a), the electrici ty (electrical 
installations) regulations and the singapore standard cp5 code of practice for electrical 
installations.  
 
all electrical work for an electrical installation, including a solar pv system, must be 
undertaken or carried out by a licensed electrical workers (lews).  such electrical work 
                                                           
1 the point of connection refers to the point at which the solar pv system is connected directly or 
indirectly to sp powerasset's substation.    
solar pv - user guide for generators  
september 2018            5 
 
includes new wiring, rewiring and extensions which have to be tested before th e 
supply is turned on.  when consumer needs any electrical work to be done at his 
premises, he is advised to check that the person whom he intends to engage to 
undertake or perform the electrical work has a valid electrical worker licence issued by 
the auth ority.  
 
it is an offence for a person:  
 
i. to carry out or caused to be carried out any electrical work unless he holds a valid 
electrical worker licence; or  
ii. to engage knowingly any person who is not a licensed electrical worker to carry 
out any electrical wo rk. 
 
for more details, you may wish to refer to elise website  for the list of lew and sp group 
website  for the preferred pv partners of sp group.  
 
electrical installation licence  
 
lew will need to apply for an electrical installation licence for the installation if the 
usage or operation of an electrical installation exceeds 45 kva of approved load for 
non-domestic purposes. e lectrical installations  are licensed  to ensure that owners/users 
of certain electrical installations engage a lew to take charge of and maintain their 
electrical installations for reason of safety.   
 
a grid -connected solar pv system is also categorised as an electrical installation.  a new 
solar pv system will be covered under the existing electrical installation licence  upon 
connection to the installation by the lew taking charge of the electrical installation.  if 
there is no existi ng electrical installation licence, the lew shall apply for electrical 
installation licence for his solar pv system.  
 
safety requirements  
 
currently under the electrical installation licensing scheme, the consumer's appointed 
lew is required to carry out safety inspection and certification of the electrical 
installation, including the solar pv system, according to the conditions specified und er 
the electrical installation licence.  
 
solar pv system s require regular inspection and maintenance to ensure that the system 
remains efficient and safe for operation.  in most cases, equipment manufacturers will 
provide maintenance guidelines for their specific components.  it is important to ensure 
that the maintenance requirement is carried out according to the recommendation and 
certified by the lew.

5. market settlement  
 
similar to other commercial generators, a standalone solar pv generator is required to 
register with the energy market comp any (emc) as market participant  (mp) ; and to 
register their solar generation facility, in order to receive payment for export of 
electricity into the grid.  they will be paid nodal price  for the selling of solar electricity 
back to the grid , and are subjected to the applicable market charges.  
 
the required registration documents can be found below.  
 
market participant registration  
* mp registration form   
* signed pso-mp agreement  and generation facility operating (gfo) agreement 
with pso (if applicable)  
 
generation facility  registration  
* the generation facility registration form  (which includes pso standing data form 
for igs)  
* approved connection agreement from sp powerasset s  
* signed mssl -mp agreement   
 
all the documents should be approved before the solar pv system is turned on.  
 
a summary of the market payments and charges for such ins tallations can be found in 
the table below.

6. intermittency  pricing mechanism  
 
given the intermittent nature of solar pv, reserves from conventional power sources 
are required to ensure system stability. for example, cloud cover or shadows may 
cause solar pv output to drop quickly, which requires the need for reserves to make up 
for the shortfall. without the back -up through reserves sources, consumers are 
exposed to the risk of power disruptions, which happened in other countries with large 
amounts of intermittent gene ration.  
 
to ensure the sustainable growth of solar, a balance has to be struck between the 
benefits of solar generation and the intermittency costs it imposes on the system. 
hence, it is appropriate to consider a mechanism, intermittency pricing mechanism 
(ipm), to allocate the fair share of reserves costs to solar.  
 
upon its implementation, the ipm will apply to all igs, except for certain groups which 
the ema had previously indicated that would not be subject to the ipm. the groups 
include:  
 
a. residential consumers with embedded solar pv systems below 1 mwac ; and  
b. non-residential consumers with embedded solar pv systems  connected to the 
system on or before 31 january 2018, unless (i ) they retrofit their igs systems such 
that re -commissioning by sp powergrid would be required in the process; or (ii) 25 
years from the commissioning date of their existing igs systems, whichever occurs 
earlier.  
 
more details on the ipm can be found in e ma's consultation paper .

7. monitoring requirements  
 
with the expec ted increase in solar pv systems in singapore, the power system 
operator (pso) would need to manage the intermittent nature of such sources to 
ensure that the security and reliability of the power system is not compromised. most 
importantly, pso also needs  to ensure that sufficient reserve capacity is available to 
respond to sudden fluctuations in solar output.  
 
hence, pso shall require solar pv systems with an installed capacity of 1 mwac and 
above  at each site/facility to provide the active power output (ac -side) of its solar pv 
system(s), sampled at one -minute intervals  and solar irradiance from sensor installed in 
close proximity to the pv panels . 
 
for more detailed technical requirement, please contact ema  at 
ema_pso_ems@ema.gov.sg .  
 
localised network limit  
 
as there may be physical constraints of each network ring, there could be a limit to the 
amount of solar pv systems that the network circuit can support. therefore, depending 
on the limitations in that area, the permissible capacity of solar pv systems in each 
location may differ. hence, parties who wish to invest in solar pv systems should check 
if there are possible network constraints in their preferred locations, before making 
their investment decisions.  
8. decommissioning requirements  
 
if you intend to decommission the entire solar pv system installed in your premises any 
time after they have been connected to the transmission system, your appointed lew 
will have to complete the decommissioning form and submit to sp power grid ltd at 
least 30 days in advance before the intended decommission commences.  
however, if the intent is to revise the solar pv capacity installed in your premises any 
time after they have been connected to the transmission system, your appointed lew 
will have to comple te the online application form and submit the following documents 
to sps via singapore power (sp) ebusiness portal : 
* document checklist and declaration of compliance to sp power grid's (sppg) 
technical requirements  
* application for net export rebate form  
* letter of consent  
* pq compliance report  
* inverter(s) specifications  
* solar panel(s) specifications
