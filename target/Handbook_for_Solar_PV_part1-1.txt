2.5  solar pv output profile
  solar  pv only produces electricity when sunlight is available. the output of a solar pv 
system varies with its rated output, temperature,  weather conditions, and time of the 
day. the power output profile of the pv installation as shown in figure 17, at a selected 
test site in singapore collected over a period from 2002-2004, in terms of its capacity 
factor2 , shows a high variation of solar pv output.

  besides  mounting pv modules on the rooftop, customised  pv modules can be 
integrated into the building facade in a creative, aesthetically  pleasing manner. they can 
be mounted on any part of the rooftop or external walls that is well exposed to sunlight 
e.g. skylights, cladding, windows, and external shading devices. 
  they  can also be integrated into external structures such as facades and canopies, as 
shown in figure 15 and figure 16, respectively.
[2] pv output capacity factor = ratio of the actual output of the pv installation at time (t) over its output if it 
had operated at full rated output.15
2.6  solar pv yield
 the amount of electricity you are able to generate from a solar pv system depends not 
only on the availability of sunshine but also on the technology you choose to install.  for 
example, a typical 10-kw rooftop solar pv system in singapore would produce about 
11,000 to 12,500 kwh annually using crystalline pv modules, and 12,000 to 14,500 kwh 
annually with amorphous silicon thin film  pv modules. 
2.7  cost of a solar pv system
  the  cost of your solar pv system will depend on many factors: system configuration, 
equipment options, labour cost and financing cost. prices also vary depending on factors 
such as whether or not your home is new, and whether the pv modules are integrated 
into the roof or mounted on the roof. the cost also depends on the system size or 
rating, and the amount of electricity it produces.  
  generally,  solar pv systems entail high capital costs.  with solar power, you can save on 
the purchase of electricity from the grid.  but even with these savings, it will take a long 
time to recover the capital cost of the solar pv installation.   the operating costs for solar 
pv installations  are negligible, but the annual maintenance  cost beyond the warranty 
period may amount to 0.5% to 1% of the capital cost of the installation.
  therefore  on an overall basis, solar pv-derived electricity is still much more expensive 
than that from the power grid.  however, the cost of solar pv has historically been falling 
by about 4% a year, and if this continues, solar pv may be competitive  within the next 
10 years. for incentives on solar pv system, please refer to appendix d.

solar pv system 
contractor
3.1  introduction
  you  will need to select a contractor to install your solar pv system.  if interested, you 
may check with the following organisations  for some solar pv system designers and 
contractors: 
  *  the  list of solar pv system companies in singapore, available from sustainable 
energy association of singapore, by calling 6338 8578 or by visiting 
    http://www.seas.org.sg/about-seas/our-committees/cleanenergy/54
  *  the  singapore sustainable  development  industry directory 2008/2009,  available 
from the singapore business federation, by calling 6827 6838 or by visiting 
    http://www.sbf.org.sg/public/publications/industrydirectory.jsp  your  contractor will appoint a licensed electrical worker ("lew") who will be responsible 
for the design, installation, testing, commissioning,  and maintenance  of your solar pv 
system. 
  in the case of non-residential  electrical installations  that require an electrical installation 
licence, the appointed lew who supervises the electrical work ("design lew") may 
not be the one who takes charge of your electrical installation ("installation  lew"). the 
design lew will then have to work with the installation lew to work out the technical 
issues. 
  please  refer to appendix b for details on how you can engage an lew and the necessary 
consultation process.17
chapter 3
appointing a solar pv system contractor
3.2  getting started  
  first,  compile a list of potential solar pv system contractors.  next, contact the 
contractors to find out the products and services they offer. the following pointers may 
give consumers a good sense of the contractor's capabilities: 
 get an experienced and licensed contractor
  experience  in installing grid-connected  solar pv systems is invaluable, because some 
elements of the installation process, particularly interconnection  with the grid, are 
unique to these systems. a contractor with years of experience will also demonstrate 
an ability to work with consumers, and price their products and services competitively.
  it is also important to get a contractor who is an lew.
 choosing between bids 
  if there are several bids for the installation of a solar pv system (it is generally a good 
practice to obtain multiple bids), consumers should take steps to ensure that all of 
the bids received are made on the same basis. comparing a bid for a solar pv system 
mounted on the ground against another bid for a rooftop system is like comparing apples 
to oranges. 
  bids  should clearly state the maximum generating capacity of the solar pv system 
[measured in watts peak (wp) or kilowatts peak (kwp)]. if possible, the bids should 
specify the system capacity in ac watts, or specify the output of the system at the 
inverter. 
  bids  should also include the total cost of getting the solar pv system components, 
including hardware, software, supporting structure, meter, installation, connection to the 
grid (if applicable), permitting, goods and services tax, warranty, and future maintenance 
cost (if applicable). 
 solar pv system warranty 
  a solar pv system is an investment that should last a long time, typically two to three 
decades for grid-connected  applications.  the industry standard for a pv module warranty 
is 20-25 years on the power output.
  there are two main components to a pv module warranty:
    *  a  workmanship  warranty that offers to repair, replace or refund the purchase 
in case of defects. the period varies from one to as long as ten years, 
depending on the manufacturer. two to five years is typical; and 18
    *  a  limited power output warranty that offers a variety of remedies in case the 
pv module's output under stc drops below certain level. most manufacturers 
warrant at least 90% of the minimum rated output for 10 years, and 80% of 
the minimum rated output for 20-25 years. take note that the minimum rated 
output is usually defined as 95% of the rated output to allow for manufacturing 
and measurement tolerances. see figure 18 for details.
 chapter 3
appointing a solar pv system contractor
  take  note that under the limited power warranty, manufacturers  seldom offer to replace 
the pv module itself. rather, at their sole discretion, they may offer to:
 
    *  repair the defective pv modules;     *  supply  enough new pv modules to replace the lost power output in a pv 
array. for example, if your 20kw pv array only produces 16.1kw under stc, 
six years after installation, the manufacturer  may opt to supply you with 1kw 
of pv modules to make up for the shortfall; or
     *  refund  you for the lost power output, after deduction according to the number 
of years in use. for a 25-year warranty, the annual deduction is normally 4%. 
for example, if you find that your 20kw pv array only produces 16.1kw under 
stc, six years after installation, the manufacturer  may opt to reimburse your 
purchase price minus 24% (6 years x 4%).
  in all cases, the manufacturer  does not cover your costs of dismounting,  transporting, 
and reinstalling the pv modules. the warranty also excludes problems resulting from 
improper installations;  repairs, changes or dismounting  by unqualified  personnel; 
accidental breakage or abuse; lightning strikes and other acts of god.figure 18. understanding a manufacturer's limited power warranty
