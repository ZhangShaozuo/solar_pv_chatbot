figure a.7.2. w est roof flank with micromorph pv modules figure a.7.1. building roof with two types of pv module
this 1960s semi-detached  house was converted into singapore's first modern zero-energy 
home by reducing solar heat gain, improving natural ventilation and adding a rooftop solar 
pv system, which generates more electricity than the 6-person household consumes.
the pv modules are mounted on rails that are clamped to the seams of the aluminium 
kalzip roof without any roof penetrations.  as an important added benefit, the pv modules 
shade the roof, keeping the attic rooms much cooler than they would be under a roof fully 
exposed to the sun.appendix a.7

b.  engaging a licensed 
     electrical worker
1.  engaging a licensed electrical worker (lew)
1.1   there  are three classes of lews: licensed electrician, licensed electrical technician, and 
licensed electrical engineer. the various classes of lews are authorised to design, install, 
repair, maintain, operate, inspect and test electrical installations  according to the conditions 
stated below:
 class of lew approved load voltage level
  electrician  not exceeding 45 kva  1000v & below
  electrical technician  not exceeding 150 kva        
  (design); not exceeding 500 kva       
  (operation)  1000v & below
  electrical engineer  no limit  subject to license conditions
1.2  the singapore standard for electrical safety applicable to solar pv systems is set out in 
the code of practice for electrical installations  (singapore standard cp5:2008), which is 
published by spring singapore. the lew whom you appoint to carry out or supervise the 
electrical works associated with your pv system will be responsible  for the compliance 
with the relevant safety standards and requirements.  
1.3   you can search for lews and their contact particulars at the following ema website:   http://elise.ema.gov.sg
1.4   for enquiries on lews, you can contact ema's electricity inspectorate branch at:
