313 somerset central is centrally located in the heart of singapore's  famous 
orchard road. the solar photovoltaic  system consists of four pv arrays, with 
a main pv array of 60 kwp mounted on the trellis, and three smaller arrays 
featuring monocrystalline,  polycrystalline  and micromorph  solar modules that 
are accessible by visitors.

this striking house stands out for its open layout, capped with twin curved roofs. the rear 
roof has a turf lawn to keep it cool, while the front roof generates electricity with flexible 
solar laminates, bonded unobtrusively  on top. this configuration  meets sentosa resort 
management's  strict guidelines for roof aesthetics, which do not generally permit bare 
metal roofs on bungalow developments.
thanks to the laminates' light weight (less than 4kg/m2), the roof can make do with a 
lighter and lower substructure cost than if it had to carry conventional clay tiles.

marina barrage spans the mouth of the marina channel, creating singapore's  15th 
reservoir, and its first in the city. 
the barrage creates a freshwater lake to boost singapore's  water supply, acts as a tidal 
barrier to prevent flooding in low-lying city areas, and keeps the water level consistent, 
offering a venue for water-based activities in the heart of the city. but more than an engineering  showpiece,  the barrage exemplifies  the national water 
agency's commitment towards environmental and water sustainability. one of singapore's largest commissioned  solar pv system at a single site to date, marina 
barrage's solar park houses one of the largest collection of solar panels - 405 panels in 
all - currently in operation in singapore. its 70kwp dc grid-tied solar pv system is the 
first to be employed on such a large scale locally, and it comes with aesthetically  arranged 
solar panels (panels are arranged in nine arrays of 15 by three panels) on the barrage's 
green roof.the solar panels generate 
50% of utility grade electricity 
for lighting and general power in the visitor centre, 
control room and offices. the 
environmentally-friendly  grid-
tied solar pv system does not require batteries, hence 
eliminating the costs for battery replacement.

the curved laboratory roof of the lonza biologic's lbxs2 factory offers prominent 
visibility to maximise public awareness for a 181kwp solar pv system on an industrial 
building. the bulk of the pv array consists of 744 pieces of rec210 modules, while 
the flatter upper section of the roof is covered with 104 sf130/2 frameless laminates 
from solar-fabrik.  without frames to trap water at shallow installation angles, these 
laminates will avoid dirt accumulation.
roof clamps were specially engineered to attach the pv module rails to the kliplok roof 
seams without any penetrations.  lonza biologics was a recipient of one of the inaugural 
solar pioneer grants under edb's solar capability scheme.
