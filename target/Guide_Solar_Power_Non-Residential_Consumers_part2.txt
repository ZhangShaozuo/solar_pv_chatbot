5.2 solar pv system 1 mwac and above but below 10 mwac  
 
there are various options for ccs to sell excess electricity back to the grid:  
 
i. register with sps under the enhanced central intermediary scheme.  under this 
simplified  arrangement, they will be paid the weighted average nodal price  through 
sps, for the selling of excess solar electricity back to grid . sps will act as a central 
intermediary, by passing through the payment and relevant market charges to 
consumers. such consumers can  either choose (a) to install a meter to accurately 
measure the solar electricity generated, or (b) to estimate their solar generation. for 
option (a), consumers will need to install the relevant metering arrangement at each 
generation point. more details on the meters can be found in section 8, ami meter 
charges. for option (b), the solar generation will be estimated based on the sgp for 
the calculations of the relevant payment and market charges. consumers need not 
install any meters.  
 
ii. register with the emc  as market participant . under this e xisting arrangement, the 
ccs are required to register with the energy market company (emc) as market 
participant (mp) ; and to register their solar generation facility, in order to receive 
payment for the selling of the excess solar electricity back to the grid.  they will be 
paid nodal price  for the selling of excess solar electricity back to the grid , and are 
subjected to the applicable market charges. such consumers can  either choo se (a) 
to install a meter to accurately measure the solar electricity generated, or (b) to 
estimate their solar generation. for option (a), consumers will need to install the 
relevant metering arrangement at each generation point. more details on the 
meter s can be found in section 8, ami meter charges. for option (b), the solar 
generation will be estimated based on the sgp for the calculations of the relevant 
payment and market charges. consumers need not install any meters.  
 
the required registration documents can be found below.  
 
market participant registration

agreement with pso (if applicable)  
 
generation facility registration

iii. register with emc as market participant (igs non-exporting ). for consumers  with 
embedded solar pv systems below 10 mwac who are not eligible for option (i) or 
(ii) and will not be selling any electricity back to the grid, they can undergo a 
streamlined market registration process and pay emc an estim ated fixed charge 
determined by ema. this fixed charge will be based on the sgp and the historical 
average rates of the respective charges.  
 
for options (i) and (ii), ccs would need to register their load and generation accounts 
under the same entity with  sps.

5.4 solar generation profile  
 
grid back -up scheme  
for summation scheme consumers who opt for sgp, there may be instances where 
they  will incur uncontracted capacity charge. for example, on a rainy or cloudy day, 
they will be consuming more electricity from the grid as their solar pv system may be 
generati ng little or no electricity. however, as the sgp is a fixed output throughout the 
year, it would indicate that the solar installation is still generating.  
hence, before deciding on the type of backup scheme and whether to opt for sgp or 
meters, consumers should assess their consumption profile and operational needs.  
solar pv - user guide for non-residential consumers  
december 2022   15 
 
they should also consider carefully the costs and benefits, including the risks and 
uncertainties due to weather variability.  
reactive power  
currently in the transmission code, high -tension consumers would be required to 
implement power factor correction measures, if deemed necessary by the 
transmission licensee, to maintain a power factor of no less than 0.85. this is because 
a load with high reactive power will require more cur rent-carrying capacity from the 
grid.  
for solar consumers who opt for sgp, there may be instances where they are penalised 
due to differences between active power output based on the sgp and active power 
output based on actual generation. this affects the calculation of gross load, on which 
reactive power penalties are determined. hence, consumers who opt for sgp may risk 
incurring reactive power penalties when actual generation values differ from sgp 
values. if so, consumers can opt out of the sgp and inst all physical meters to accurately 
measure the active power output.  
6. intermittency  pricing mechanism  
 
given the intermittent nature of solar pv , reserves from conventional power sources 
are required to ensure system stability. for example, cloud cover or shadows may 
cause solar pv output to drop quickly, which requires the need for reserves to make up 
for the shortfall. without the back -up throug h reserves sources, consumers are 
exposed to the risk of power disruptions, which happened in other countries with large 
amounts of intermittent generation . 
 
to ensure the sustainable growth of solar, a balance has to be struck between the 
benefits of sola r generation and the intermittency costs it imposes on the system. 
hence, it is appropriate to consider a mechanism, intermittency pricing mechanism 
(ipm), to allocate the fair share of reserves costs to solar.  
 
upon its implementation, the ipm will apply to all igs, except for certain groups which 
the ema had previously indicated that would not be subject to the ipm. the groups 
include:  
 
a. residential consumers with embedded solar pv systems below 1 mwac ; and  
b. non-residential consumers with embedded solar pv systems  connected to the 
system on or before 31 january 2018, unless (i) they retrofit their igs systems such 
that re -commissioning by sp powergrid would be required in the process; or (ii) 
25 years from the commissioning date of their existing igs systems, whichever 
occurs earlier.  
   
solar pv - user guide for non-residential consumers  
december 2022   16 
 
more details  on the ipm  can be found in ema's consultation paper .  
7. monitoring requirements  
 
with the expected increase in solar pv systems in singapore, the power system 
operator (pso) would need to manage the intermittent nature of such sources to 
ensure that the security and reliability of the power system is not compromised. most 
importantly, pso also needs to ensure that sufficient reserve capacity is available to 
respond to sudden fluctuations in solar output.  
 
hence, pso shall require solar pv systems  with an installed capacity of 1 mwac and 
above  at each site/facility to provide the active power output (ac -side) of its solar pv 
system(s), sampled  at one -minute intervals  and solar irradiance from sensor installed in 
close proximity to the pv panels.  
 
for more detailed technical requirement, please  contact ema  at 
ema_pso_ems@ema.gov.sg .  
 
localised network limit  
 
as there may be physical constraints of each network ring, there could be a limit to the 
amount of solar pv systems that the network circuit can support. therefore, depending 
on the limit ations  in that area, the permissible capacity of solar pv systems in each 
location may differ. hence, parties who wish to invest in solar pv systems should check 
if there are possible network constraints in their preferred locations, before making 
their investme nt decisions.  
8. ami meter charges  
 
this section is only applicable to consumers who register their embedded solar pv 
systems with sps under the central intermediary scheme, or with emc as a market 
participant.  
 
the owner of the generation facility (i.e. solar pv system) is the meter equipment 
service provider (mesp) for the meter installation associated with it. however, 
consumers with embedded generation facility (with installed capacity of less than 10 
mwac) ma y choose to engage sppg to provide, install and maintain the generation 
meter.
